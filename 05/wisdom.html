   Time stamps on files taken from a digital camera

When mounting my cameras on linux system (Slackware 10.0), the time in
a photo's exif information is correct but the file time isn't.

File date    : 2005:12:22 15:54:52
Date/Time    : 2005:12:22 16:54:52

I've checked back and it looks like it started when summer time ended.
When mounted on my Mac powerbook, the date stamp is correct so the
culprit appears to be the linux computer.

The fstab entry is

/dev/sda1        /mnt/camera1     vfat        users            0   0

with the camera connected to a usb port which I mount with:

mount /mnt/camera1

I have UTC in /etc/hardwarclock and get the right answer from the date
command:

Thu Dec 22 17:08:59 GMT 2005

Is there a magic incantation for fstab or mount or deep in the bowels
of the usb modules that can solve this problem?

  <p>   
   ...
   Talking about your clock problems it might be a good idea to add some
   explanation. Usually Unix systems use UTC time internally. The unix system
   has a configuration file to know how to translate the UTC time to the
   local time of the system. It is also possible to use the TZ environment
   variable to show the date of other timezones. Examples:
  </p><pre class="listing">
   $ date
   Fri Dec 23 08:25:17 CET 2005
   $ date -u
   Fri Dec 23 07:25:36 UTC 2005
   $ export TZ=UTC
   $ date
   Fri Dec 23 07:26:02 UTC 2005
   $ export TZ=GMT+9
   $ date
   Thu Dec 22 22:26:26 GMT 2005
   $ export TZ=Brazil/West
   $ date
   Fri Dec 23 03:27:48 AMT 2005</pre>
  <p>
   Some simple operating systems do not use UTC time internally. With those
   you need to have the local time in your CMOS setup. Then you will also
   have to make sure that the time in CMOS setup is adjusted for daylight
   savings. Dual booting with such a simple operating system usually means
   that you will have to configure Linux to use local time in CMOS.
  </p><p>
   Your camera is probably running a rather simple OS. That means it is using
   local time instead of UTC time. If time stamps in Linux file system is
   very important to you it would be possible to change the time in the
   camera to UTC time. However, then you would allways see the UTC time in
   exif info and on the camera.

  <p>
   That is inherent in the different ways Linux (UTC) and Windows (vfat)
   handle the DST change. In general Linux is trying to show you what the
   UTC date/time, corrected for the LINUX timezone, would have been.
   This is because Windows stores files with "local date/time" and Linux
   in UTC, buts SHOWS them in current locale time. So the corrections
   in Winter and Summer differ by one hour on vfat filesystems and so
   date/time on vfat filesystems will normally change by 1 hour twice
   a year.

I am looking for some software that will over write the files on the HD

  <p>   
   Important:  Don't use any programs related to security, which are not
   widely known.  Don't use any programs related to security, for which
   there is no source code publicly available.  Especially forget GUI
   programs, as they tend to substitute security by comfort.
  </p>
  <p>   
   There is a (not so) little command line program especially designed for
   this purpose.  It's called 'shred' and is preinstalled on almost any
   non-Windows system.  Its main intention is to wipe out entire data
   storage devices.  By default it overwrites the device 25 times, which
   should be enough to make data effectively physically unrecoverable.  If
   you believe that this is not enough, you may increase this amount.  But
   be prepared to wait quite a while for it to finish.
  </p>
  <p>   
   To make data unrecoverable on magnetic storage, it's not enough to
   overwrite it with purely random data (e.g., <tt class="verb">/dev/urandom</tt> output).
   This
   does not only take forever, it's not even secure.  Shred uses special
   patterns to overwrite the storage.  By calling it with the <tt class="verb">-v</tt> option,
   you can see those patterns.
  </p>
  <p>   
   If you want to securely delete your entire <tt class="verb">/dev/hda</tt>, it's enough to
   type:
  </p><pre class="listing">
   # shred /dev/hda</pre>
  <p>   
   To overwrite 45 times instead of 25, do this:
  </p><pre class="listing">
   # shred -n45 /dev/hda</pre>
  <p>   
   Making data unrecoverable is not enough in all cases.  Sometimes it's
   good to make the hard-disk look like it never had any previous
   filesystem, which might be interesting.  You may want to add a final
   overwrite with zeros.  You can do this with the <tt class="verb">-z</tt> option:
  </p><pre class="listing">
   # shred -z /dev/hda</pre>
  <p>   
   This is intended to trick people inspecting your hard-disk.  But
   personally I would classify a hard-disk filled with zeros as very
   suspicious.  Don't do this.  Instead, read on.
  </p><p>
   After the shred command returns, I really recommend creating a new
   partition table and install a fresh operating system.  This confuses
   possible attackers, as they expected an 'empty' hard-disk.
  </p><p>
   Sometimes you even need to be more smart.  Sometimes it isn't even good
   enough to make the hard-disk look innocuous.  If you really want to
   trick most people, then I would even create an encrypted filesystem with
   some random key, and fill it with one large file generated by
   <tt class="verb">/dev/zero</tt>
   or <tt class="verb">/dev/urandom</tt> (which one really doesn't matter for an encrypted
   filesystem-use <tt class="verb">/dev/zero</tt>, it's a lot faster).
  </p><p>
   An attacker will find that encrypted filesystem and try to break the
   encryption, possibly making the 'real' data harder to recover with each
   try.

   Any reasons to filter ARP packets?
  </h3>

<pre class="quest">
From: Mikhail Zotov
Date: March <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.security/msg/bb90b17d0b1a8d79?hl=en&amp;">28</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.security/msg/df0498afed59bdaf?hl=en&amp;">29</a> 2006 
Newsgroup: comp.os.linux.security

My home Linux machine is connected to a big LAN, which consists of
hundreds and maybe even thousands machines.  All machines have IP
addresses from the 10/8 pool. I am running a simple iptables firewall on
my machine but it is useless most of the time because there seems to be
very little threat from (mostly Windows) machines in the LAN. Packets
blocked by the firewall are, as a rule, just Windoops noise. If I observe
probes of different ports on my machine I just call the ISP and the
problem is solved.

At the same time, the network device is open for ARP packets since
filtering of ARP packets is not supported by netfilter. Thus I wanted
to understand whether ARP packets can be used to put anything to my
machine (say, spyware) or get anything from it or just get any type of
access to it.  According to the docs I have found so far, this is
impossible because ARP packets don't have place for anything "useful".
By posting my question, I wanted to make sure that my understanding is
correct.

  <p>   
   ARP filtering would not hide the system by itself. On broadcast media
   (coax, twisted pairs with hubs, wireless) all traffic is detectable
   anyway. On switched media, the switch has to know all, even if ARP
   is disabled, never mind filtered.
  </p>
  <p>
   Packets on Ethernet style networks (includes wireless) are moved using
   MAC addresses. Some O/S monitor traffic and complain if another host is
   detected using "my" MAC address.  Look up "ARP spoofing".
  </p>
  <p>
   ARP is one of two methods used to translate between IP and MAC addresses.
   On a static network, you can disable ARP by using hard-coded data (ethers
   files), <tt class="verb">/sbin/arp&nbsp;-s</tt>, and <tt class="verb">/sbin/ifconfig&nbsp;-arp</tt>.
   This may or may not improve
   your security, but is usually a pain in the a$$ to set up and maintain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hardware addresses (and IP itself) is only as secure as your control of
   access to the network, though encryption helps quite a bit. If you are
   concerned about attack mechanisms using ARP or hardware addresses, you
   need to be looking at other problems as well. 
  </p>
  <p>
   You can use static ARP tables (and disable ARP on the media itself), but
   this offers no protection from someone using
  </p><pre class="listing">
   /sbin/ifconfig -hw ether 08:00:de:ad:be:ef</pre>
  <p>
   to change the MAC address their interface is using. In a intelligently
   configured switched network, the switch <em>MAY</em> be configured to only
   permit "a" specific MAC address on any specific port, and of course
   the system that is being spoofed <em>MAY</em> detect some other host sending
   packets with it's MAC address and complain, but the story boils down
   to control of access to the network.  Poker is a popular card game
   played with an ordinary deck of cards-but when dealing with computer
   security please remember that "Physical Access Beats Five Aces". 
   Think about that.

   Well, the ARP filter has a very good reason to be.  It's ARP poisoning.
   This is an attack, which allows you to redirect network traffic as you
   like, if the network is not protected against it.  This is the case,
   when the hosts in the network use dynamic ARP tables.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now whether you really need the ARP filter depends on the operating
   systems used.  Given you have operating systems, where static ARP
   entries cannot be changed remotely (i.e., not Windows), there is no
   reason for ARP filtering.  If you don't use static ARP entries, then you
   are going to need ARP anyway, so you can't filter it effectively.  If
   you do, then you don't need it at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, if there is even a single Windows machine in the network, then
   I strongly recommend setting up static ARP tables on that host and
   filtering any ARP packets from it.  Windows allows static ARP entries,
   but they are only static in terms of they don't have any timeout and
   they (should) survice reboots.  They can be overridden remotely.
   Unfortunately, Windows doesn't have any ARP filter.
  </p>
  <p>
   In all cases, use static ARP tables, if possible, to prevent ARP
   poisoning.  This attack is worse than ARP flooding, because it allows
   for MITM attacks easily.  Several command line utilities are available
   to take over SSH connections and the like.
  </p>
  <p>
   A much better setup would be one, where you don't rely on consistent ARP
   tables at all.  For example, use key-based authentication, if possible.
   This makes ARP poisoning useless, because there is no MITM attack
   against key-based authentication protocols. 
  </p>
  <p>
   The ARP intentionally doesn't leave any space for
   payloads in the packet.  However, as every network packet, an ARP packet
   has a 'size' field, which can well be set larger than the packet itself
   really is.  So, you <em>can</em> transmit payload with ARP packets, but they
   get just ignored (as long as there isn't some special purpose
   application, or some classic network stack bug).
  </p>
  <p>
   Now to the ARP itself.  There are mainly two kinds of attacks via ARP.
   They can be launched in every switched ethernet (very likely you are in
   one of them).  They are called ARP flooding and ARP poisoning.
  </p>
  <p>
   ARP flooding:  As you know, the ARP is used to resolve IP addresses into
   MAC addresses.  All network hosts and the switch itself keep track of an
   internal ARP table containing such resolutions, which have already taken
   place.  The size of this internal table is limited.  Most switches
   switch to a hub-like mode, when it gets overflown.  This allows an
   attacker to easily intercept <em>any</em> traffic in the network.
  </p>
  <p>
   ARP poisoning:  Essentially the goal of this attack is similar, but the
   method is quite different.  You can always send arbitrarily constructed
   ARP packets, and other hosts in the network will honour them.  So with
   forged ARP packets, you can redirect network traffic to other machines
   and let them act as routers.  This allows the interception attack
   mentioned above, too, but also a few other attacks.  By redirecting
   network traffic intended for the internet gateway to a non-existent
   machine, you can isolate it completely, making internet access
   impossible (for a short period of time, until the ARP entries expire).
   You can also redirect traffic for other hosts to your machine, and then
   act as a router to send them to the real destination.
  </p>
  <p>
   The latter method allows an attack, which is called the 'man in the
   middle' (MITM) attack.  With this one, you can not only intercept
   network traffic, but even manipulate it.  As a funny attack, you could
   intercept a chat session and also write forged messages for your victim,
   without him noticing this.  Now, there is a much more serious MITM
   attack.  If not set up properly (i.e., in the default configuration), you
   can decrypt almost <em>any</em> encrypted connection.  Yes, this includes
   SSH/SSL connections, so you can very well get access to remote machines
   (via SSH) or steal credit card information (via SSL, e.g., via HTTPS).
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words:  The insecurity of the ARP protocol is a major threat in
   every switched ethernet.  You can overcome this problem by using static
   ARP tables.  If you use static ARP tables on your host, then outgoing
   traffic cannot be intercepted or manipulated anymore.  Incoming traffic
   from a host using dynamic ARP tables, however, can be.  And there is a
   case, where static ARP tables are even not possible:  When the hosts
   have dynamic IP addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are two ways to defend yourself (but not others) against ARP
   poisoning, so that <em>your</em> traffic cannot be intercepted.  Don't rely on
   the expiration time of ARP entries.  You could lower it.  Luckily, when
   an MITM attack gets out of synchronization (i.e., not <em>all</em> packets get
   caught by the attacker), then it is lost in most cases.  This way, you
   can force a desynchronization sooner or later, and detect the attack.
   Secondly, add a static ARP entry for 'important' hosts like the router.
   They are going to have static addresses in most cases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just add static ARP entries for 'important' hosts, like the router.  By
   this, you can defend against MITM attacks for packets from you to the
   router (but not the other way), and sometimes this speeds up
   communication.  But you don't gain any further security; especially you
   cannot defend against sniffing in a switched ethernet.  The attacker
   always has the ability to do ARP flooding, effectively turning the
   switch into a broadcast device.  There is nothing you could do about
   that. 
  </p>
  <p>
   The other way is not to use ARP and MAC addressing at all, effectively
   turning your interface to a broadcast interface.  That will increase
   network traffic, and you can't defend yourself against interception with
   this.  But it makes an MITM attack impossible.  You can turn MAC
   addressing on and off, so I recommend doing this for the setup phase of
   encrypted connections.  After the connection is established, you can
   return to normal behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
   So I have to repeat:  Forget ARP filtering; secure your connections
   otherwise, using cryptographic techniques.  To prevent sniffing, you
   need encryption.  To prevent MITM attacks (which include sniffing), you
   need proper authentication (i.e., key/certificate-based).  In other
   words:  You need both.  Personally I don't use certificates, because
   they are effectively the same as keys, but unlike keys they include
   identity information.  There is nothing bad about that, but using keys
   is simpler, and more widely supported (example: SSH cannot handle
   certificates).
