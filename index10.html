		<p>It seems there is another minor problem in the -current branch. It relates
		to <b>ImageMagick</b>. Suppose you want to add a line to a screenshot. You
		open <tt>screenshot.png</tt> with <b>display</b>, then go to <i>Image Edit</i>,
		select <i>Draw</i>, <i>Element</i> (line), its colour and width, then switch to the image, draw
		a line&nbsp;&#8230; but it does not appear. Luckily, the problem is easily
		fixed. All that is needed is to recompile <b>ImageMagick</b>, possibly
		after <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php">downloading</a>
		its latest version (6.6.6-1 at the moment of this writing).
		</p>

		<p class="date">November 19, 2010</p>
		<p>Everybody who follows the -current branch has surely noticed huge updates
		that took place earlier this week. I couldn't stand and installed them on
		two machines with different video cards. Almost everything works just fine!
		Cyrillic fonts look a bit unusual in Firefox but this is not crucial.
		<b>gv</b> has a minor problem but it can be easily fixed by a 
		<a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/339394">patch</a> provided by Gentoo.
		Eric&nbsp;Hameleers has published interesting and useful
		<a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/huge-update-to-slackware-current-and-what-it-meant-to-my-laptop/">comments</a> on the latest update.
		</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="date">October 16, 2010</p>
		<p>Life is going on (still or once again?) and there are new changes
		in the <a href="http://www.slackware.com/changelog/">ChangeLog.txt</a> of the -current branch.
      The changes include updates of the kernel, glibc, and the GNU Compiler
		Collection as well as a few minor ones. Thus, this is high time
		to update the system. But not only. Eric&nbsp;Hameleers has prepared
		a <a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/building-libreoffice-from-source/">package</a>
		of the beta release of
		<a href="http://www.documentfoundation.org/">LibreOffice</a>,
		a fork of OpenOffice.

		<p>We've got to know about another distribution based on Slackware
		and its new release. The distro is called <a href="http://sms.it-ccs.com/">Superb Mini Server (SMS)</a>.
		According to the site, SMS is a &quot;distribution with
		web, DNS, DHCP, file, print and fax servers, iptables firewall, mail
		server with spam filter and anti-virus scanner, and BitTorrent station.
		It also includes Webmin, a web-based administration tool, but no
		graphical desktop.&quot; Another quote is taken from the <a href="">FAQ</a>:
		<i>Why Slackware? 	top Two Reasons a. I like it and I find it the best
		Linux distro for me ;-) b. Because for Servers you want simplicity and
		stability, and I didn't find anything other more stable and secure than
		Slackware.</i> Good luck, SMS!</p>

		<p class="date">September 6, 2010</p>
		<p>Distrowatch has published a review of another distribution based on
		Slackware, <a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100906#feature">AUSTRUMI-2.1.6</a>
		this time. The project seems to be worth trying as a live CD.
		</p>
		<p>There are two additions to our <a href="links.html">Slack Links</a>.
		These are <a href="http://www.imagineos.com.br/blog/">Imagineos</a>
		(formerly GoblinX), a bootable live CD or pendrive distribution based on
		Slackware, and <a href="http://dotnew.sourceforge.net/">dotnew</a>,
		an utility aimed to help with the management of .new system
		configuration files. Dotnew is another project by George&nbsp;Vlahavas,
		who also maintains <a href="http://depfinder.sourceforge.net/">Depfinder</a>,
		a tool that finds dependencies of Slackware packages.</p>

		<p class="date">September 4, 2010</p>
		<p>Well, <i>Summer's almost gone, We had some good times</i> :-) Now, it's time
		to get back to Slack, and this is always fun.  Meanwhile, Distrowatch has
		published a <a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100823#feature">review</a>
		of <a href="http://www.salixos.org/">Salix 13.1.1</a>, a distro for
		the most lazy Slackers :-)  Even though Caitlyn Martin is known to be, hmmm,
		a bit sceptical about Slackware, her review of Salix seems to be pretty
		balanced.</p>

		<p class="date">July 2, 2010</p>
		<p>Dear fellow Slackers! We are very happy to publish one more, and probably
		the last one, interview related to the Slackware release 13.1. This time,
		our guest is Stuart&nbsp;Winter, one of the Slackware developers and
		maintainer of <a href="http://www.armedslack.org">Slackware ARM</a>, which
		already has its third release.
		<a href="2010/stuart-winter-on-armedslack-13.1.html">Enjoy!</a>
		</p>

		<p class="date">June 11, 2010</p>
		<p>This time, good news have come from South Africa.
		<a href="http://www.kongoni.co.za/">Kongoni GNU/Linux</a> isn't dead but
		is approaching the next release. Recall that Kongoni is based on Slackware
		but employs the ports system for building packages. Its development was
		stopped earlier this year.</p>

		<p>There are two additions to our <a href="./links.html">Slack Links</a>. These are
		another <a href="http://www.slackware.ru/">Russian resource</a> dedicated to Slackware
		and <a href="http://www.dawoodfall.net/slackbuilds/noversion/mkslack/">mkslack</a>,
		a SlackBuild generator script by David&nbsp;Woodfall

		<p>Dear fellow Slackers! We are happy to publish an
      <a href="2010/eric-hameleers-on-slackware-13.1.html">interview
		with Eric&nbsp;Hameleers</a>, a member of the Slackware core team.
      As well as the earlier <a href="2010/robby-workman-on-slackware-13.1.html">interview
		with Robby&nbsp;Workman</a>, it is devoted to the recent release of Slackware-13.1.
      Enjoy!

		<p>Another review of Slackware release 13.1 followed by good reader's
		comments is <a href="http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/314666-slackware-131-a-linux-distro-that-gets-out-of-the-way">published</a>
		by Linux.com. A good read if you have a few spare minutes.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.xstore.co.za/wordpress/?p=733">The Slackware 13.1 Interview</a> by Robby Pedrica
      seems to be the first review of the latest Slackware release written in English.
		To the contrary to the review published by LinuxJournal, this one was written
		by a person who seems to know well the subject of his writeup, so that we can
		recommend it to our readers.</p>

		<p class="date">May 30, 2010</p>
		<p>Dear fellow Slackers! We are happy to publish an <a href="2010/robby-workman-on-slackware-13.1.html">interview
		with Robby&nbsp;Workman</a>, a Slackware
		developer and one of the mainainers of the <a href="http://slackbuilds.org">SlackBuilds.org</a> project,
		he has kindly given us on the occasion of the Slackware-13.1 release. Enjoy!
		</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="date">May 26, 2010</p>
		<p>On May 24, the world got to know that Slackware-13.1 was <a href="http://www.slackware.com/announce/13.1.php">released</a>
		<a href="http://www.slackware.com/releasenotes/13.1.php">a few days earlier</a> :-)
		Though a bit late, we sincerely congratulate all Slackers with the new release
		of the best Linux distro in the known Universe!
		</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="date">May 7, 2010</p>
		<p>Congratulations to all slackers in the world!  The long-awaited
		Slackware-13.1 BETA1 was released yesterday, and
		&quot;<a href="http://www.slackware.com/changelog/current.php?cpu=i386">A stable
		release should be just around the corner</a>&quot; :-)
		The BETA1 has the latest stable kernel, the latest versions of openssh, openssl,
		firefox, KDE, and many other programs.</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="date">March 7, 2010</p>
		<p>Many of those who compile <a href="http://tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>
		do probably use an excellent <a href="http://slackbuilds.org/repository/13.0/office/texlive/">SlackBuild script</a>
		by Robby&nbsp;Workman. Unfortunately, it does not work on the -current
		branch after the latest updates. Compilation breaks with an error message like</p>

		<pre class="listing">pngimage.c:(.text+0x24c): undefined reference to `png_check_sig'</pre>

		<p>The problem can be fixed with a <a href="2010/texlive.png14.patch">patch</a>
		similar to one of the patches used for building teTeX. Just insert a line
		like</p> 

		<pre class="listing">cat $CWD/texlive.png14.patch | patch -p1 --verbose || exit 1</pre>

		<p>somewhere just below the first <tt>chmod&nbsp;-R&nbsp;a-s&nbsp;.</tt></p>

		<p>And here they go! A <a href="http://www.slackware.com/changelog/current.php?cpu=i386">bunch of updates</a>
		for the -current tree and a number of security patches for regular releases.
		Don't miss a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.slackware/msg/4d23dfb44e6110ea">post by Robby&nbsp;Workman</a>

		<p><a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/slackware-changelog-stalling-or-not/">Slackware ChangeLog stalling&#8230;
		or not?</a> Eric&nbsp;Hameleers provides an answer to the question that
		keeps Slackers from sleeping quietly for a month now. Robby&nbsp;Workman adds
		a few more details (see reader's comments below Eric's post). In short:
		be ready for the show ;-)</p>

		<p>A feature story of Issue 343 of Distrowatch Weekly is devoted to
		comparison of three desktop distributions based on Slackware, namely,
		<a href="http://www.zenwalk.org/">Zenwalk</a>,
		<a href="http://www.salixos.org/">Salix</a>, and
		<a href="http://www.goblinx.com.br/">GoblinX</a>.
		All three use Xfce as the default
		desktop environment, all three have nice artwork, all three employ
		automated package management.  But which is the best of the three?
		You can find a point of view of Bernard Hoffmann

		<p>There are a number of new items in our <a href="links.html">Slack Links</a>.
		<a href="http://www.slackstuff.com/2010/01/ode-to-slackware/">Ode to Slackware</a>
		by usr_local is&nbsp;&#8230; well, what says the title :-) The Ode is inspired
		by <a href="http://www.itpro.co.uk/619540/slackware-linux-less-is-more/">Slackware
			Linux&mdash;Less is More</a>, an article by Richard Hillesley published by
		ITPro.  The articles do not contain any technical information but thoughts
		about Slack, including its history, and Linux in general.  A nice weekend reading.</p>

		<p>Two other new items also relate to the history of Slack and partially overlap.
		The first one is <a href="http://slackdown.co.uk/history.html">Unofficial History
			of Slackware releases</a> by Tom Newsom. Another one is 
		<a href="http://www.nielshorn.net/slackware/slack_versions.php">A complete overview
			of all Slackware versions</a> by Niels Horn, who maintains a few
		<a href="http://www.nielshorn.net/slackware/">other materials</a> related to Slack.</p>

		<p>The history of Slackware development is also briefly covered in a talk
		made by <a href="http://www.t-dose.org/2009/speakers/eric_hameleers">Eric Hameleers</a>
		at <a href="http://www.t-dose.org/t-dose/2009/schedule">T-DOSE 2009</a>
		(&quot;Technical Dutch Open Source Event&quot;).
		Probably more interestingly, Eric Hameleers has also covered Slackware
		package management. A pdf file with the slides of his talk can be found
		<a href="http://connie.slackware.com/~alien/tdose2009/t-dose-slackware.pdf">here</a>
		(about 500kB).</p>

		<p>Hello everybody in the new year! There are a couple new links in our
		<a href="links.html">Slack Collection</a>. One is <a href="http://slackpackpkgman.wordpress.com">Slackpack</a>,
		a package manager by Pavloudis Zisis aka <a href="http://mysticalgr.co.cc/">Mystical Groovy</a>.
		According to the docs, Slackpack &quot;<i>has a friendly GUI
		environment and can install packages, list installed packages, remove
		Slackware Linux packages (.tgz or .txz), and convert to .tgz format from
		.deb or .rpm. It can download Slackware Linux packages from package
		repositories, and can create .tgz packages from an application's source
		code.</i>&quot; Good luck, Slackpack!</p>


		<p>Another link leads one to <a href="http://wigglit.ath.cx/">A Pooling
		of ##slackware and Slackware Resources</a> by <a href="http://www.wigglit.com/">Ron Sinclair</a>.
		It's not easy to follow listings of discussions on ##slackware but
		sometimes they happen to be pretty helpful.
		The site also contains a number of links to resources related to Slackware.</p>
