 <p>Happy Slacking in 2010! New links are to follow soon :-)</p>

 <hr>

 <p class="date">November 15, 2009</p>
 <p>There are a few more entries in our <a href="links.html">collection</a> of Slackware-related
 links.  First, this is <a href="http://blog.tpa.me.uk/category/linux/slackware-linux/">a series of posts</a>
 by a UK-based IT specialist who calls himself Zordrak.  Among them,
 a HOWTO on setting up an <a href="http://blog.tpa.me.uk/2009/10/17/openldap-in-slackware-13-0/">OpenLDAP
 server in Slackware-13.0</a> seems to be especially worth mentioning.</p>

 <p>One more link points to a writeup by Donnie&nbsp;Tevault &quot;<a href="http://beginlinux.com/desktop_training/168-slackware/1427-slackware-package-management">Easy Update
 and Package Management for Slackware&nbsp;13</a>&quot;.  This can be a helpful reading for
 Slackware novices.</p>
 
 <p>Last but definitely not least, we have added a separate link to a HOWTO
 on <a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:network">configuring a network in Slackware</a>
 by Eric&nbsp;Hameleers. To the best of our knowledge, the subject hasn't been
 covered in such detail elsewhere. Have a good read!</p>

 <hr>

 <p class="date">October 25, 2009</p>

 <p>Nobody doubts writing a review of a scientific article or book needs
 a certain level of expertise on the subject.  Modern Linux distributions
 are complicated things, not anyhow simpler than at least some branches
 of science. Still, we have all seen so-called reviews that roughly
 follow the following scheme: "Something went wrong in my fed0buntu, and
 I decided to try the brand new release of Slackware Linux. Oh, Gosh! It
 still uses an ncurses-based installation! Oh! It assumes I know how to
 use cfdisk! Oh! Oh! It lacks my favourite game and when I tried to
 install it from this_site I found Slackware has no dependency tracking!
 The developers must fix this immediately, otherwise nobody
 will ever want to use this crap in the 21st century!"</p>

 <p>Luckily, there are also <i>real</i> reviews.  In our opinion, good examples of
 well-written reviews are provided by Robby Pedric. <a href="http://www.xstore.co.za/wordpress/?p=473">Here</a>
 one can find his review of Slackware-13.0, and <a href="http://www.xstore.co.za/wordpress/?p=307">here</a> is an older
 review of Slack-12.2. Both are added to our <a href="./links.html">Slack Links</a>.</p>

 <p>Another addition to our collection of Slackware-related links is <a href="http://www.salixos.org/">Salix</a>,
 a desktop-oriented distro that is, according to the developers, fully compatible with Slackware.
 Salix occupies one CD but has a rich repository. The installation program is
 based on that of Slack but differs from it in a number of items. In particular, one
 cannot choose separate packages but has a choice of three pre-selected sets: "Core",
 "Basic", and "Full". The Core set provides a console environment. The Basic one
 provides Xfce with Firefox and a few other essential programs as well as <b>gslapt</b>.
 The Full mode provides installation of a richer set of GUI applications, including
 OpenOffice.  By default, Salix starts a graphical login manager with the root
 login being prohibited. Thus, a user other than root is suggested to be created
 during installation.</p>

 <p>Salix provides a <a href="http://download.salixos.org/i486/13.0/salix/">repository</a>,
 which includes packages that do not ship with Slackware but should work in it.
 One final thing to mention is that Salix supports dependency checking. This
 can probably attract some Linux novices. All in all, Salix has made a good
 impression on us and we wish its developers good luck!</p>

 <p class="date">September 13, 2009</p>
 <p>Two interesting Slackware-related writeups attracted our attention last week.
  The first one is written by Daniel Armstrong and covers the subject
  of installing Slackware-13.0 on Asus EEE netbooks. The howto covers
  installation from a USB stick and creating an encrypted file system. It can
  be found <a href="http://wooush.com/node/3">here</a>.  Another writeup
  is dedicated to adding miscellaneous multimedia software to Slack.
  It was written by Darrell Anderson and can be found <a href="http://humanreadable.nfshost.com/sdeg/multimedia.htm">here</a>.
  The text dates back to July and thus refers to Slackware-12.2
  but is mostly applicable to release 13.0, too.</p>
 <hr>

 <p class="date">September 4, 2009</p>
 <p>Linux Magazine has published an <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7502/1.html">interview with Eric Hameleers</a>
 (aka <a href="hearts.html#alien">Alien BOB</a>): &quot;<em>Why you should try Slackware?</em>&quot;
 We thank Christophe for letting us know about this great reading!</p>

 <hr>

 <p class="date">August 30, 2009</p>
 <p>We sincerely congratulate all slackers with the long-awaited release
  of Slackware 13.0! <a href="http://www.slackware.com/announce/13.0.php">Here</a>
  is the official announcement, and <a href="http://www.slackware.com/releasenotes/13.0.php">here</a> are the release notes,
  a must-read for everybody willing to install the brand new release :-)
  And don't forget to check <a href="http://slackbuilds.org">SlackBuilds</a>
  if you are going to build a package not included in the release.
  <a href="http://slackbuilds.org/ChangeLog.txt">Here</a> is the list of
  updates the guys prepared especially for Slack-13.0.  Thanks men!!</p>

 <p>We would also like to attract attention of reades/users of Slack to 
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.slackware/msg/f247da541a6f86a7">a post
  by Henrik Carlqvist</a>, in which he presented a script he used to patch kernels
  in Slackware 12.0 and 12.1.  The patch closes a hole <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/347006/">found recently</a>
  in almost all versions of the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.</p>

 <hr>

 <p class="date">July 15, 2009</p>
 <p>Many of us are eagerly waiting for the next release of Slackware to appear
  really soon now.  Meanwhile, there is something to read. First, we suggest
  <a href="http://linuxcritic.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/the-story-of-how-i-found-slackware-linux-or-once-you-go-slack-you-never-go-back/">The story of how I found Slackware Linux</a>,
  or ``Once You Go Slack, You Never Go Back,'' by Trent&nbsp;Isaacson.  Besides
  this articles, one can find many interesting writeups by Trent related
  to Slackware and Linux in general in <a href="http://linuxcritic.wordpress.com/">his blog</a>.</p>

 <p>Another blog that we have added to <a href="links.html">Slack Links</a>
  is called&nbsp;&#8230;
  <a href="http://gnu-linux-slackware.blogspot.com/">Slackware Blog</a> :-)
  It is maintained by Ismail&nbsp;Demiral.  The blog contains a number of short
  howtos and is definitely worth looking at.  We thank Christophe for letting
  us know about it.</p>

 <p>Are you a new Slackware user or do you want to recall being one?
  In either case, <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/the-beginner-s-guide-to-slackware-linux-609245">The beginner's guide to Slackware Linux</a>
  by Mike&nbsp;Saunders is a writeup that can be handy. Enjoy!</p>

 <hr>

 <p class="date">June 21, 2009</p>
 <p>It seems we are approaching the great day when another version
 of Slackware is released :-)  Personally, I am very curious whether
 it will employ the 2.6.30 kernel or not.  This kernel seems to have
 <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/113478">a whole lot of changes</a>.</p>

 <p>A minor advice for those who haven't tried the latest updates of the X
 system yet.  It might be useful to add the following lines to <tt>xorg.conf</tt>
 before you start&nbsp;X:</p>
 <pre>
	Section "ServerFlags"
		Option "AllowEmptyInput"  "false"
	EndSection
 </pre>
 <p>Otherwise there's a chance you will find yourself with both the keyboard
 and the mouse being switched off.</p>

 <p>Last but not least: we have one more link in our list of
 <a href="links.html">Slack Links</a>. This time, it is
 <a href="http://jtgzmanager.sf.net">QTGZManager</a>, a Qt4 frontend to <b>pkgtool</b>
 by Alexandre&nbsp;Albuquerque&nbsp;Arnt.  Thanks, Alexandre!</p>

 <p class="date">May 24, 2009</p>
 <p>Installation of a Linux distro is a situation when one appropriate pic
 is worth a dozen words.  This point of view is probably shared by
 Grant&nbsp;Coady, who has recently installed the brand new 64-bit
 version of Slackware, and shared his experience in a series of screenshot.
 You can find it <a href="2009/slack64/vm64.html">here</a>.
 Thanks Grant!
 </p>

 <p class="date">May 18, 2009</p>
 <p>Everybody have probably noticed that Slackware left traditional
 gzipped packages for packages compressed with <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/">xz</a>,
 an utility that grew up from the <a href="http://tukaani.org/">Tukaani</a> project.
 We were curious how the new tool works during installation.  The answer is
 "perfectly".  Installation of the -current branch goes fast and smoothly.
 Interestingly, the installer now suggests <b>ext4</b> as the default file system.</p>

 <p>We have tried a number of programs included in -current. The only minor
 issue we have found thus far relates to <b>mc</b>.  It cannot save its
 settings unless one creates the <tt>~/.mc</tt> directory beforehand.
 </p>

 <p>For those who would like to upgrade to -current from the 12.2 release,
 Distrowatch.com has published
 <a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090518#feature">brief notes</a>
 on the procedure using
 <a href="http://wiki.github.com/rg3/slackroll">slackroll</a>, a Python
 script by Ricardo&nbsp;Garcia.</p>

 <p>Another Slackware-related news that is probably worth mentioning is a new
 desktop-focused distribution based on Slack.
 Its name is <a href="http://www.kongoni.co.za/">Kongoni</a>,
 which means "Gnu" in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shona_language">Shona language</a>.
 Kongoni originates from the land of a strange distro the name of which is
 sometimes translated as "Slackware is too hard for me" ;-)  It uses the ports
 system for downloading sources and building packages and comes in two flavours:
 one for 32-bit, another for 64-bit systems.
 Kongoni only includes software released under licenses approved by the
 <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a>.
 </p>

 <p class="date">April 27, 2009</p>
 <p>A few new links are added to our <a href="links.html">Slack Links</a> :-)
 First, we have got to know about a <a href="http://www.inlv.demon.nl/slackbuilds/">rich collection of SlackBuild scripts</a>
 maintained by Martijn Dekker.  The scripts we have tried thus far worked
 like a charm.  Whenever possible, they present an `all-in-one' solution:
 the scripts perform downloading of the source files if necessary,
 <tt>slack-desc</tt> are included in the scripts, etc. Another nice
 feature of the scripts is that they do not need root privileges due to
 employing <a href="http://packages.debian.org/fakeroot">fakeroot</a>.
 We highly recommend everybody to try build scripts written by Martijn Dekker.</p>

 <p>Another bit of news came from Jesper Juhl who had found our list and
 kindly let us know about <a href="http://www.chaosbits.net/Articles/Historical/">Slackware-related</a>
 articles he wrote in the past.  As Jesper points out, the writeups are
 mostly interesting from the historical perspective but the
 <a href="http://www.chaosbits.net/Articles/Historical/SlackwareFAQ/">FAQ</a>
 and <a href="http://www.chaosbits.net/Articles/Historical/SlackwareTools/">an
 introductory material on pkgtools</a> can still be quite useful for new users.
 Thanks, Jesper!  We are looking forward for your new writeups!</p>

 <p>Last but not least, <a href="hearts.html#danieldekok">Dani&euml;l de Kok</a> has announced on AOLS that
 he doesn't use Slackware any more (alas!) but there is
 an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/slackbasics-i18n/">active team</a>, that
 translated his <a href="http://www.slackbasics.org/">Slackware Linux Basics</a>
 to Brazilian Portuguese. Thanks Dani&euml;l, and good luck in your new life!</p>

 <hr>

 <p class="date">March 29, 2009</p>
 <p>A couple of new links were added to <a href="links.html">Slack Links</a>.
 The first one is
 <a href="http://helmut.hullen.de/filebox/Linux/slackware/ap/">aliens2slack</a>,
 is a set of two scripts by <a href="http://helmut.hullen.de/">Helmut Hullen</a>
 and an older script by Tony Borras. The scripts convert Debian and RPM packages
 to Slackware ones. A good feature of <b>debian2slack</b>, included in the
 package is that it not only converts a <tt>.deb</tt> file into a <tt>.tgz</tt>
 one, which isn't a problem by itself, but also creates <tt>slack-desc</tt>,
 <tt>doinst.sh</tt> and takes care about configuration files that should not be
 overwritten during installation of the created package.
 </p>
 <p>Another new item is
 <a href="http://arktur.de/">Arktur</a>, a Slackware-based school server 
 used in more than 2000 schools in Germany and abroad. Happy Tuxing, dear
 scholars! :-)</p>

 <p class="date">March 22, 2009</p>
 <p>St. Patrick's Day Parade <a href="http://www.stpatrick.ru/english/events.htm">took place</a> in Moscow today. We use the occasion to send our sincere greetings to Patrick
 <a href="http://www.slackware.com/~volkerdi/">the Man</a> :-)
 </p>
 <p>We are also publishing <a href="2009/slacknotes-12.2.html">Slack Notes on Slack-12.2</a>, which were waiting for their time for two months :-) Comments are welcome!</p>
 <hr>

 <p class="date">March 15, 2009</p>
 <p>On March, 9, a huge update of the -current branch was performed
	probably taking us much closer to Slackware-13.0 :-)
	Patrick updated dozens and dozens of packages and the kernel. Now,
	the -current branch has the 2.6.28.7 kernel, new kernel headers,
	compilers, a number of updated and new applications and libraries.
	Last but not least, KDE-3 is replaced with KDE-4.
 </p>

 <p>I couldn't stand and updated slack-12.2 to -current.  This wasn't
	hard to decide since I've been running the 2.6.28.7 kernel for quite
	a while already, as well as self-compiled versions of a number of 
	updated apps.  The upgrade went smoothly but a few minor issues.
	The biggest problem related to making a HP LaserJet 1160 work.
	To do this, I had to recompile <b>hplip</b>.  Besides this, I restored
	<b>a2ps</b> from Slack-12.2 because I failed to figure out how to make
	booklets and similar stuff with the updated version (4.14). One final
	issue to mention is that a number of older apps cannot be compiled
	with the new compilers (GCC-4.3.3).  All other updated packages
	I have checked thus far work just fine.</p>

 <p>I take the chance to attract your attention to a number of new
	<a href="links.html">Slack Links</a>: <a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/AST/">AST</a>
	("Alien's SlackBuild Toolkit") by <a href="hearts.html#alien">Eric Hameleers</a>
	and two Slackware-based distributions: <a href="http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/">Damn Vulnerable Linux</a>
	and <a href="http://pars-linux.com/">Parslinux</a>.</p>

 <p class="date">February 9, 2009</p>
 <p><a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090209#news">Distrowatch</a> 
 has cited a <a href="http://linux.blogs2k.com/2009/02/06/finding-slackware-packages-easily/">post</a>
 on a new Slackware-related resource called <a href="http://slackfind.net/en/">Slackfind</a>.
 From the project site:</p>
 <blockquote>
  Slackfind is a nonprofit project which stores metadata and provides
  search tools for slackware-packages across various repositories. The
  project idea has been taken from rpmfind.net, a similar project for
  rpm-based distributions.
 </blockquote>
 <p>Interestingly, the project is hosted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irkutsk">Irkutsk</a>,
 a town in the heart of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a>.
 It is also remarkable for us that on January&nbsp;14, 2007, we
 <a href="./index07.html">wrote</a> discussing various resources of SlackBuild
 scripts: &quot;<i>I seems the Slackware community could benefit much of
 a searchable database of such projects.</i>&quot;</p>

 the leading developer of <a href="http://www.absolutelinux.org/">Absolute Linux</a>,
 a lightweight desktop-oriented derivative of Slackware. In particular, Paul&nbsp;Sherman says:
 &quot;I choose Slackware and made it as lightweight as possible so that
 Absolute could be installed on commodity hardware. <em>Nothing is as fast
