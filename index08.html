 <p class="date">December 27, 2008</p>

 <p>&quot;At a time when new and buggy features cloud basic computer
 functions, it's refreshing to see a new release of a distro like
 Slackware that stays true to its core philosophy&nbsp;&#8230; Slackware
 isn't for everyone. But in a landscape where distro and application
 developers are increasingly catering to new Windows converts, it's nice
 to have one who's sticking to his original goals. Slackware is still
 keeping it simple for Linux users who like using Linux.&quot;

 <p>The latest release of DistroWatch Weekly News 
 <a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20081215#news">reports</a>
 on the Faculty of Physical Sciences at the University of Glasgow recently 
 <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/it/connections/features/headline_93317_en.html">migrating
 their main logon server across to Slackware Linux</a>.
 "<em>I have never liked Red Hat (too many 'extras' between you and the
 operating system), ditto SUSE, and looking at the top twenty Linux
 distributions on DistroWatch, I could see that many were more suited to
 desktops, while many more had no 'pedigree' and were simply re-vamped
 editions of something else. Then my eye hit upon an old-timer that was
 said to be a bit difficult, devoid of GUI management tools, and rock
 solid. Yep, I'm talking about Slackware, the oldest surviving Linux
 distribution, now at version 12.1</em>". According to DistroWatch, the author 
 is happy to be re-acquainted with his old friend Slackware and is 
 recommending it to others for use on their servers.  And so do we :-)

 <p><a href="http://ostatic.com/174435-blog/zenwalk-slackwares-moment-of-zen">Zenwalk: Slackware's Moment of Zen</a> 
  is a recent review of a Slackware-based distribution that has its own package
  management tool.  According to the author of the review, 
  "<a href="http://www.zenwalk.org/">Zenwalk</a> is more like
  Slackware than some of the Slackware-driven pendrive distributions."
 </p>
 <p>
  S&eacute;bastien Boillod has released another tool aimed to simplify
  package management.  According to the author, 
  "<a href="http://requiescant.tuxfamily.org/spack/index.html">Spack</a>

 <p>What is the difference between `the Debian way' and `the Slackware way'
  in the field of distribution management? This is the question discussed
  in a recent blog `<a href="http://blog.sillica.com/2008/06/11/debian-troubling-signs-can-slackware-teach-us-anything/">Debian&nbsp;&mdash;
  troubling signs; can Slackware teach us anything?</a>'
  &quot;The idea is to really attempt to illuminate people on why&nbsp;&#8230;
  a classic approach such as Slackware still has merit in this world of modern
  feature-crazy distributions.&quot;

  There have already been a few reviews of Slackware 12.1 here and there.
  Hardly any of them was worth spending a minute to read since they mostly
  boiled down to a kind of discussion of `philosophy behind Slackware.'
  Finally, Linux.com <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/136601">published a review</a> of a person
  who really installed version&nbsp;12.1 and now shares his experience
  with the readers as well as provides a number of useful links and hints.

  As we all know, Slackware release 12.1 is to appear soon, and this
  is probably the best news, but today we'll look back into March
  and list a number of articles published somewhere outside the
  slack world but still worth reading (in our very humble opinion :-)
 </p>

 <p>
  <i><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/howto/undelete_ext3.html">HOWTO
  recover deleted files on an ext3 file system</a></i>, by Carlo Wood.
  &quot;It happens to everyone sooner or later: a split second after you hit
  Enter you realize your mistake, but it's too late; you just deleted a
  valuable file or directory for which no backup exists. Or maybe you have
  a backup, but it's a month old&#8230;and in shock you see the past month
  flash before your eyes as you realize in pain what you'll have to do all
  over again&#8230;&quot;
  An interesting reading regardless of whether you use ext3 or not.
 </p>

 <p>
  <i><a href="http://bcable.net/system.php">My Awesome Secure and Portable
  System</a></i>, by Brad Cable.
  An interesting writeup with a lot of technical details on building a secure
  system on a 1GB USB drive.  The core of the system is
  <a href="http://www.grml.org/">GRML</a>
  (a Debian-based live CD for sysadmins) but some of the ideas implemented can
  be used on other systems.
 </p>

 <p>
  <i><a href="http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html">Why, oh WHY, do those
  #?@! nutheads use vi?</a></i>, by Jon (the article actually dates back to May, 2007).
  A nice writeup providing a number of well-thought examples
  demonstrating how effective can <b>vi</b> be in comparison with `usual'
  text editors.
 </p>

 <p>
  Last but not least, it's finally <a href="2008/impression.of.spring.jpg">spring</a> in Moscow, and this is
  definitely another good news&nbsp;:-)

  Dear fellow slackers,
 </p>
 <p>
  We are very glad to present <a href="2008/amikit.html">the second article</a>
  by Tom&nbsp;Newsom on running Amiga in Linux.  This is not just a review
  of another Amiga emulator but an emotional history of the process
  of creating and debugging a working port of
  <a href="http://amikit.amiga.sk">AmiKit</a> to Linux.
  Yes, it's hard to believe but <a href="2008/amiga.html">Tux meets Amiga</a>,
  published earlier this year, caused or at least stimulated the appearance
  of a great new tool for all fans of Linux and Amiga.
 </p>
 <p>Enjoy!</p>

	&quot;Contrary to popular assumptions, DRAMs used in most modern

<p>Dear fellow Slackers,</p>

<p>
After another period of inactivity (or, rather, activity not related
to Slack), here is a brief review of materials that attracted our attention
in late 2007 and January, 2008.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html#jfs">JFS file system</a></li>
	<li><a href="index.html#src2pkg">src2pkg</a></li>
	<li><a href="index.html#iso">Rebuilding iso files for Slackware-12.0</a></li>
	<li><a href="index.html#cli">"Command Line Life Partner Wanted"</a></li>
</ul>

<p id="jfs">
In mid September, 2007, Linux.com published an article
<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/119025">"30 Days with JFS"</a>
by Keith&nbsp;Winston, in which the author shared his positive experience
of using the <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-jfs.html">JFS file system</a>
on Slackware.
The article inspired me to use JFS (and <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/">XFS</a>,
which I have never used before either) when installing Slack-12.0 on a server and on a desktop
machine.  I haven't performed `stress tests' as did
Keith&nbsp;Winston but still I am pretty satisfied with both systems, since
I had no problems with them thus far.  I am especially glad
that I have replaced ext3 with JFS and XFS on a desktop machine
since there are no more long <b>fsck</b>-ing on multi-gigabyte
partitions.  I have even converted a Linux partition on
a USB flash stick to JFS, and it works fine&nbsp;:-)
</p>

<p id="src2pkg">
Another article that attracted my attention was
<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/121499">Slackware's "magic package maker"</a>
by Drew&nbsp;Ames, devoted to
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/amigolinux/download/src2pkg/"><b>src2pkg</b></a>,
a tool by Gilbert&nbsp;Ashley that implements an approach to
building Slackware packages alternative to using SlackBuild scripts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Src2pkg</b> can build packages from sources, from RPM and Debian packages,
and from binary packages.  Building a package can be as simple as
</p>

<pre>
$ src2pkg htop-0.7.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
though this is probably not the best way.
Still, there is at least one important point to notice: <b>src2pkg</b> allows
an ordinary user to build `real' packages.  The package will even
contain a <tt>slack-desc</tt> file though in this particular case it won't
contain any useful information.  Interestingly, in certain cases
<b>src2pkg</b> is able to create a `good' <tt>slack-desc</tt> file basing on the
information it finds in the source package.  These `automatically
created' <tt>slack-desc</tt> files have permissions that make them world-writable
but I believe this doesn't affect the quality of a package much.
</p>

<p>
<b>Src2pkg</b> has a comprehensive HOWTO, together with man pages
and a FAQ. Certain useful advices on using the tool can be found
in <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/novice-mistake-using-src2pkg-ver1.8-610707/">this</a>
thread on LinuxQuestions.org
</p>

<p>
I have faced some minor problems when using <b>src2pkg</b> for buiding packages
for <tt>/usr/local</tt> instead of <tt>/usr</tt> but all in all I think <b>src2pkg</b>
is a great tool worth trying, especially in case a satisfactory SlackBuild script is
not available.
</p>

<!--                      -->
<p id="iso">
A number of users have faced problems when trying to boot
an installation CD/DVD of Slackware-12.0 on older computers.
In <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/bootable-cd-with-slackware-12-582855/">this thread</a>
on LinuxQuestions.org, Alien Bob
explains that the way to fix the problem is to rebuild
the iso file using '<tt>-boot-load-size&nbsp;4</tt>' (as is actually
suggested in <tt>isolinux/README.TXT</tt>).  Other options that can
improve building a bootable image have been
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.slackware/msg/86fb63805cc4e785">suggested on AOLS</a>
by Joerg Shilling, the author of <b>cdrecord</b>.
</p>

<!--                      -->

<p id="cli">
On January&nbsp;21, Slashdot informed the readers about a
<a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/08/01/21/1540229.shtml">CLI approach
to finding a life partner</a> (yes, a woman!&nbsp;;-).
Probably more sad than humorous,
<a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/nyc/485967082.html">"Help me keep the shell people alive"</a>
caused hundreds of comments by Slashdot readers.
Enjoy if you haven't read it yet.
