<p><font size="+1" color="#CC0000">Happy holidays for everybody having them!</font>
As a holiday gift, kernel 2.4.34 was released recently.
Even in case you already know about the release, I suggest
you read the <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/478493">announcement</a>
made by Willy Tarreau and&nbsp;...&nbsp;find a name of
a <a href="http://slackworld.berlios.de/hearts.html">true slacker</a>
helping to maintain the kernel.&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>Some time ago I asked a legendary AOLS regular (and, accidentally,
a musician) <a href="./hearts.html#loki">Loki Harfarg</a> to tell me about
the gear used to record his latest album
<a href="http://l0k1.free.fr/adirtydozen-en.html">&quot;A Dirty Dozen&quot;</a>.
If you have ever thought about playing in a rock band or having
a rock group of your own or just wondered if there is anything in common
between Music and Linux, you should definitely read Loki's story.
Here it comes:<br>

Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>Thank you, Loki!</em></p>

<p>On October 3, <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/">SecurityFocus</a>
published an article <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1878">Recent
Security Enhancements in NetBSD</a> by Elad Efrat. The article
&quot;presents the NetBSD philosophy on security,
major design decisions, and its current security features.&quot;
Though NetBSD-oriented, I think the article is actually of general interest.</p>

<p>On October 2, <a href="http://www.reactivated.net/weblog/">Daniel Drake</a> released
version&nbsp;0.72 of the
<a href="http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html">Writing udev rules</a> HOWTO.
Version&nbsp;0.7 of the HOWTO was released earlier this year. It can be found in
<tt class="verb">udev-097-i486-10.tgz</tt>, present in Slackware-11.0.

<p>The biggest surprise of the week was the discovery of
<a href="http://slackware.tomsk.ru">http://slackware.tomsk.ru</a>,
a site of the <em>Slackware</em> LUG in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomsk">Tomsk</a>, a city in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a>.
The site is in Russian, but
I am sure even a person who does not read Russian (yet) will
appreciate the clean design of the site.
Information on the site is interesting and up-to-date.
Remarkably, every page has its own motto dedicated to Slackware.
The one I liked most of all reads as &quot;<em>Slackware.
The soul of my computer</em>.&quot;
All in all, this is the best Russian site devoted to Linux
I have seen thus far.</p>

<p>The following articles attracted my attention 
during last couple of weeks. First, a couple of articles related
to computer security:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/search/searchtips.php">Six Tips to
	Protect Your Online Search Privacy</a>, published by the
	<a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, and</li>
 <li><a href="http://security.linux.com/security/06/09/21/1411257.shtml?tid=35">Fear the Metasploit Framework</a>,
	by Joe Barr (published by <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux.com</a>).
	The article briefly covers a possible usage of the
	<a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit Project</a>,
	the goal of which &quot;is to provide useful information
	to people who perform penetration testing, IDS signature
	development, and exploit research.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Another couple of articles reveal a number of tips that can be useful
when working (having fun&nbsp;;-)) in the CLI:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-productivitytips.html">UNIX productivity tips</a>,
	by Michael Stutz (published by
	<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/">IBM's resource for developers</a>),
	and</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=597697&amp;seqNum=1&amp;rl=1">Learning About Linux Commands</a>, by Scott Granneman.
	This is a sample chapter of
	<a href="http://www.informit.com/title/0672328380">Linux Phrasebook</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two articles are probably most useful for novices but perhaps
an intermediate level user can will also find a couple of interesting tips.</p>

<p>Another interesting tutorial has been written by
<a href="http://slackworld.berlios.de/hearts.html#grant">Grant&nbsp;Coady</a>.
This time, the <a href="http://bugsplatter.mine.nu/misc/winx.html">document</a>
describes how one can make X&nbsp;applications
running on a Slackware client be displayed on a windoze desktop.
Those interested in the problem will probably also benefit from
studying <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/129/pitcher.html">A Prisoner
of Windows</a>, by Lew&nbsp;Pitcher (published in
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/129/index.html">Issue&nbsp;#129</a>
of the <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/">Linux Gazette</a>.)</p>

<p>
Dear Slackers:</p>

<p>
Hello and welcome!</p>

<p>
We are glad to talk to you again, after a long time since the
release of the <a href="./04/toc.html">fourth issue</a> of <em>The Slack World</em>.</p>

<p>
First of all, we are glad to tell you that the <a href="./05/toc.html">fifth issue</a> is
ready. We do hope that you will enjoy it, even though the issue is not
as "thick" as the earlier ones (but that doesn't surely mean the
content is any less rich than in the previous issues).  And this is
the reason why we are posting this announcement on the front page
instead of on a separate "Editorial" page.</p>

<p>
We are toying with plans to change the format of the project.  On the
one hand, preparing "full-blown" issues requires both quite a bit of
time (that we just don't have) and interesting articles (that you
don't write&nbsp;;-)).  On the other hand, we want to make the project
"lively", and to provide links to articles and projects that we find
interesting, and to possible comments on other issues that we find
worth mentioning.  No, we are not going to post links to everything
that relates to Linux or Slackware but only to those resources that we
find interesting. Neither we are going to turn the project into a
blog.  Besides this, we will publish featured articles as they arrive
without postponing them till another issue.  All this doesn't mean
that we are dropping the initial idea of the project.  We just adopt
it to the ever-changing conditions of life.&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>
A few words about the latest changes.  First, there is one new
direction in the project called <a href="./hearts.html">Slack Hearts</a>.
The point is that
there are many <em>very</em> interesting persons among you, slackers, but the
earlier "schedule" of releasing the issues didn't allow us to invite
all of them to be our "Persona Grata".  Thus, we decided to
(temporarily) fill the gap this way.  Temporarily, because we are
going to invite many of the slackers to be our guests and to give us
interviews, which will be published immediately.</p>

<p>
Besides this, there are a number of new links in our <a href="./links.html">SlackLinks</a>
list.  The last minor change is that the earlier "Archive" section is
renamed to <a href="./issues.html">"Issues"</a>.</p>

<p>
Thanks to everybody for the kind words of support.  Feedback and
articles are always welcome!</p>

<p>
We hope you will enjoy this installment of <em>The Slack World</em>. Till
the next update, have a nice read.</p>


<p>
Yours,<br><br>

Editors of <em>The Slack World</em><br>
