	Answers a Few Questions on the Occasion of Slackware-13.37 Release
 </h2>

 <p>
  Published: May 15, 2010
 </p>

<p>Dear fellow Slackers! We are happy to publish an interview with
<a href="../hearts.html#alien">Eric Hameleers</a>, a core Slackware developer,
he has kindly given us on the occasion of the Slackware-13.37 release. Enjoy!
An earlier interview can be found <a href="../2010/eric-hameleers-on-slackware-13.1.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p><em>
 It seems it was a long and winding road from Slackware 13.1 to
 Slackware 13.37, with a series of massive updates of the -current
 branch. What was the most hard work on the road? What didn't satisfy
 you all the time?
</em></p>

<p>
As you are well aware, a primary objective for Slackware (and essentially
that of its creator Pat Volkerding) is to release &quot;when it is ready&quot;.
I think that the first time I mentioned to Pat that he should be thinking
about finalizing what would become Slackware-13.2, was as far back as
November or December. But Pat held out, waiting for a kernel version that
he was satisfied with. That took a while! And the situation of driver
stability in X.Org is a permanent source of frustration. It seems that we
can never make everybody happy at the same time using any combination of
X.Org, mesa and dri versions. That is the reason why you find alternative
versions of mesa and the nouveau driver in the <tt>/testing</tt> directory
of Slackware 13.37.
</p>

<p>
I think that the involvement of the Slackware community in testing
slackware-current has helped a lot in determining what would be the best
time to release 13.37. I personally believe it was stamped &quot;final&quot; on
a golden moment in time.
</p>

<p>
Important to note is that there has been a lot more interaction between
the &quot;core developers&quot; including Pat, and the community during this
development cycle. Especially on the <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/">Slackware forum</a>
there were many
threads which had contributions from the team. Good input has been coming
from Freenode's ##slackware IRC channel as well. Those discussions have
absolutely been beneficial to the QA testing of this release. So many
small and big issues were quickly resolved by having someone mention them
in a public place where we could pick them up. Slackware does not have a
public bug tracker but it does not need one either. The lines between
developers and community are extremely short.
</p>

<p><em>
 There were quite a lot of diverse packages added to Slackware this
 time, for example, <b>xaos</b>, <b>yasm</b>, <b>moc</b> (a killer, IMHO! :-), <b>ddrescue</b>,
 and <b>lxc</b> to mention a few.  How do new apps find their way to
 Slackware? Is there some generic way or each new app has its own way?  
</em></p>

<p>
New packages usually don't get added for no reason at all. Some of
these additions are born out of need (<b>ddrescue</b>) or desire (<b>moc</b>). The most
noteworthy addition was that of <b>xaos</b>, to commemorate the death of Benoit
Mandelbrot. <b>Yasm</b> is a requirement for building several packages now&mdash;I
think in Slackware only mozilla-firefox absolutely needs it. I was glad
about the addition anyway because my own <b>vlc</b>, <b>ffmpeg</b> and <b>x264</b> packages
(and perhaps more) require it too, and having it present in Slackware by
default makes my life as a packager easier.
</p>

<p>
The list of new packages for 13.37 is not all that big. I expect a lot
more additions when the new KDE and XFCE which Robby and I are
maintaining outside of Slackware finally get merged into
slackware-current.
</p>


<p><em>
What do you think are the most remarkable changes in this release
besides `just' updates of software like compilers, browsers, KDE, etc.?
</em></p>

<p>
Even the &quot;just updates&quot; to software can have a big effect on
the way you experience the distro. For instance, the version of KDE in
Slackware 13.37 is a lot more enjoyable than that of 13.1. The new
version of X.Org delivers a lot of punch, leaving HAL behind and working
much better with a lot of hardware. The same is true for the new kernel. 
</p>

<p>
I was very pleased with the updates to the Slackware installer. I
personally think that the first experience of any person with Slackware
is a very important moment, because that initial emotion largely
determines whether the person will stick with Slackware or not. That is
the reason why I like to work on the installer, and the documentation in
the root of the DVD. I can only hope to influence that first experience
with Slackware and make it more enjoyable. The HTTP/FTP network install
was born out of that belief. And now I was able to add an easy to setup
PXE server, very handy if you have a netbook for instance without a DVD
drive and no USB stick to boot from. But large-scale Slackware
deployments should benefit from it too.
</p>

<p>
And no&#8230; with that first experience I do not mean pretty GUI
installers or hiding the kernel's boot messages behind a splash screen.
Slackware targets a specific type of users, and already I can see the
effect of Slackware becoming more desktop-friendly. People get confused
sometimes; is Slackware a desktop distro? Is it a server distro? None of
that&mdash;Slackware is everything. And you can make it do anything.
</p>

<p>
Since 13.37 was released, there is a larger amount than usual of people
that come to the Slackware forum and IRC channel with what I would call a
&quot;Ubuntu mind&quot;. Of course there are some that give up quickly when
they discover that knowledge and a desire to learn is required for using
Slackware. I thoroughly enjoy it when people are not scared away by the
command prompt or when they are told to use vi for editing configuration
files, and show determination in mastering our beautiful distro.
</p>

<p><em>
 There are more than a thousand packages included in the release. Some
 projects maintain mailing lists or RSS feeds but some do not. How do
 you solve the problem of tracking changes that take place with the
 programs and libraries that ship with Slackware?  
</em></p>

<p>
I think that Pat Volkerding has a good eye for available updates. He has
feelers everywhere it seems. The other members of the team that
contribute to the package updates (for instance Robby&nbsp;Workman, Piter&nbsp;PUNK
and me) each have an affinity with parts of Slackware. I stick with
tracking updated to software like KDE and its dependencies, but I rarely
look at stuff like UDEV, X.Org or XFCE.
</p>

<p>
This time, Slackware includes a number of kernels of different
versions: the 2.6.37.6 kernel as the main one, the 2.6.38.4 kernel
in the /testing directory, and even configs for kernels 2.6.35.12
and 2.6.39-rc4.
With the kernel releases appearing more often than seasons change,
how do you decide which kernel to choose for the release (besides
making a cute name for the release :-)?
</p>

<p>
There are these silent periods in Slackware development when new stuff is
being tested. I believe a lot of time is spent working on kernel
configurations and picking exactly the right one for Slackware. Even if
that kernel is not a &quot;long-term-support&quot; version. A typical Slacker
will eventually upgrade his kernel anyway and recompile it to suit his or
her needs.
</p>

<p><em>
 A question by Douglas Mayne, an AOLS regular:
 I am interested in hearing about cgroup process scheduling that are
 available for the first time in the default kernel. I would like some 
 general information about it. Perhaps, some benchmarks could be
 generated for a similar group of desktop applications running on 13.1
 vs. 13.37.  
</em></p>

<p>
If someone would run these benchmarks and publish the results, I would be
happy to look at them. I never touched cgroups before but after reading
this question, I explored the Internet a bit about process scheduling and
light virtualization and it sure looks interesting. I will certainly
experiment with it in the near future. Maybe even write a Wiki article
about it.
</p>

<p>
How do you personally update/patch your Slackware systems and what do
you think is the recommended way of doing this for rank-and-file Slackers?
Is it slackpkg, a combination of crond and rsync or what?
</p>

<p>
I usually hesitate at any form of automation in Slackware's package
management. Having said that, I have been using <b>slackpkg</b> since when it
was still in <tt>/extra</tt> and rely on it to upgrade my systems between
stable releases. With a bit of care that will never go wrong. And because
I run slackware-current on a couple of computers and do experiments with
new versions of packages, that tends to &quot;pollute&quot; my Slackware. I use
<b>slackpkg</b> to bring these computers back into a &quot;sane&quot; condition.
</p>

<p>
I do not schedule automatic package updates as a cron job because I
believe that it is the responsibility of the system's administrator
(you!) to know the exact status of the system. That means: you have to
manually run any system update.
</p>

<p>
The one thing that I never let any tool do, is to upgrade the kernel. I
use a generic kernel, combined with an initial ramdisk image. My approach
is to install new kernel (-generic, -firmware, -modules) packages in
parallel with the running kernel (using installpkg, not upgradepkg) so
that I can always go back to the old kernel if the new one has issues. I
then create a new initrd.gz file using my
<tt>mkinitrd_command_generator.sh</tt> script which got added to the mkinitrd
package sometime ago, update <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> and run <b>lilo</b>. Better
safe than sorry!
</p>

<p>
Of course, manually keeping my system up to date does not mean that I do
not have a warning system in place. I have another script running as a
nightly cron job which checks the Slackware ChangeLog.txt for updates and
downloads these updates to my home&mdash;and then sends me an email so that I
know there is work to do. Works really well!
</p>

<p><em>
Are there any chances of bringing back GNOME into stock Slackware releases?
</em></p>

<p>
You know, I was a Gnome user until it got removed from Slackware. I
switched to KDE then but I did not like the look and feel of it (it
looked too much like an unsuccessful attempt to copy another well-known
Operating System)&#8230; that is why I used (and still am using) XFCE on a
few of my computers. That is to say, until they released KDE4. That is
how an integrated Linux desktop should look and work!
</p>

<p>
I still use Gnome on computers at work and really have no issues with it.
I also think that the <a href="http://gnomeslackbuild.org/">GNOME SlackBuild</a>
project delivers a high-quality
version of Gnome for Slackware. But it requires a pretty large effort to
maintain Gnome for Slackware. The packaging and integration process is so
much more convoluted and complex than it is for KDE. These factors make
it unlikely that Gnome will ever return to Slackware's core.
</p>

<p><em>
What are the nearest plans for the next development cycle?
Do you plan to update openssl, XFCE, anything else?
Are there any definite plans for the next release or does much depend
on the `upstream' developers?
</em></p>

<p>
At the start of a new development cycle, there is this wide empy field of
vision. Anything can happen! Personally I would be happy to see KDE 4.6
or 4.7 added to Slackware's core. I am quite satisfied with the KDE
version 4.5.5 which shipped with Slackware 13.37 because it really is
better than the first releases in the 4.6 series.
</p>

<p>
I believe that KDE 4.6.4 and onwards could become the preferred choice
for KDE in Slackware -current. The changes that this update requires
(such as adding <b>udisks</b> and <b>upower</b>, the successors of our old HAL) will
almost automatically clear up the path for a XFCE upgrade. The new XFCE
shares a lot of depedencies with the new KDE.
</p>

<p>
There are other ideas for the next release of course, but I am not at
liberty to discuss them and anyway, it is Pat who decides what goes and
what not.
</p>

<p>
I will keep myself busy with things like building future versions of KDE,
and providing LibreOffice and VLC packages for the community. That gives
me a lot of satisfaction. I also found that my blog can act as a medium
to discuss my activities with interested people. There is of course the
LinuxQuestions.org forum but some things I like to keep close at heart.
</p>

<p><em>Eric, thanks a lot for another exciting interview!
We wish you the best of luck in all your activities!
