		<p>One of the hottest news ever: Patrick Volkerding can be

		Public Radio.</p>

		<p class="date">October 11, 2011</p>
		<p>Good, interesting reviews of Linux distributions don't come often.
		A good, interesting review of Slackware is even a more rare reading.
		That is why it was that nice to find <a href="http://all-things-linux.blogspot.com/2011/10/slackware-1337-perfect-for-my-laptop.html">Slackware
		13.37&mdash;Perfect for My Laptop</a> in a blog by Barnaby.
		More than this, Barnaby has written a whole <a href="http://all-things-linux.blogspot.com/search/label/slackware">bunch</a>
		of writeups dedicated to running and configuring Slack.</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="date">September 19, 2011</p>
		<p>Today, we have a few more additions to our collection of
		<a href="links.html">Slack&nbsp;Links</a>. These are two writeups
		by Andrew&nbsp;Strong on <a href="http://www.andrews-corner.org/leafnode.html">configuring
		Leafnode-2</a> and <a href="http://www.andrews-corner.org/irssi.html">connecting to Freenode
		with SSL/SASL</a> under Slackware. There is actually other interesting
		reading at <a href="http://www.andrews-corner.org/">Andrew's Corner of the Web</a>
		though it doesn't always relate to Slack. The author warns his site
		&quot;will never be more than 20 or so pages big&quot; thus don't
		wait too long to visit it ;-)
		</p>

		<p>Another addition is <a href="http://sous-marin.tuxfamily.org/">Sous-marin</a>,
		&quot;a small, pure, individualized Slackware installation
		system using only scripts and a minimum of resources.&quot; It is
		accompanied by <a href="http://sous-marin.tuxfamily.org/tools.html">Sous-marin tools</a>,
		which are &quot;bash scripts for analyzing and maintaining a
		minimized Slackware installation but can all be used on normal
		Slackware installations as well.&quot;
		Both projects come from <a href="http://this-voice.org/author.html">R.&nbsp;Earle&nbsp;Harris</a>.
		Sous-marin employs <a href="http://requiescant.tuxfamily.org/pages/PAGE20101026G.html">GUST</a>,
		a tool for generating tagfiles by Seb&nbsp;Boillod, the author
		of the <a href="http://requiescant.tuxfamily.org/spack/index.html">Spack</a>
		package manager.
		</p>

		<p>Finally, the collection of Slackware-based projects is enriched
		by <a href="http://porteus.org/">Porteus</a>, a portable distro
		to be used from a USB stick, CDROM, etc.

		<p>Everybody has heard about <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_29#head-e1bab8dc862e3b477cc38d87e8ddc779a66509d1">Kernel Mode Setting</a>
		but problems with configuring consoles and X jump out again and again, especially
		with new drivers and old CRT monitors. Aaron&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Hsu has taken time to write a brief
		instruction on treating these problems. For those not having access to AOLS via Usenet,
		the writeup <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.slackware/browse_thread/thread/fcbaf14f6c95e2fc#">can be found</a>
		via Google's gateway.</p>

		<p>
		There are not much news related to Slackware these days. One of the latest
		updates of the -current branch included <b>lilo-23.2</b>. With it installed,
		a computer of mine with an encrypted root file system refused to boot.
		Reverting back to the older version of <b>lilo</b> fixed the problem. YMMV.
		</p>
		<p>There has been an update to <a href="http://slkbuild.sourceforge.net/">slkbuild</a>,
		an interesting tool aimed to simplify building packages in Slackware. According
		to its author (George&nbsp;Vlahavas), <b>slkbuild</b> was inspired by
		<b>makepkg</b>, used in <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a> Linux.
		<b>Slkbuild</b> seems to be employed in <a href="http://www.salixos.org/">Salix</a>,
		a well-known derivative of Slackware.
		</p>
		<p>Last but not least: Grant&nbsp;Coady is at a rehab center. We have
		already received a few short messages from him. He thanks all slackers
		who sent him their kind wishes and miscellaneous Linux stuff. <em>We are
		waiting for you Grant, and are keeping our fingers crossed!</em></p>
		<hr>

		<p class="date">July 20, 2011</p>
		<p>Better later than never! :-) <em>Happy Birthday, Slackware!</em>
		Why birthday? Read a post by Willy&nbsp;Sudiarto <a href="http://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2011/07/slackware-turns-18.html">here</a>.
		</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="date">July 17, 2011</p>
		<p>
		<a href="./hearts.html#grant">Grant</a> is doing a little better every day, his legs are still not doing
		much. He has tried to get out of bed three time. Fell on the floor once.
		Head neck and arms are working good. The rest of is still floppy like a
		rag doll, he can not support himself  in a chair.
		</p>
		<p>
		Good news is Grant realizes this and realizes his muscle tone has
		deteriorated so he is trying to move his legs. So for the first time he
		is trying to help himself. His thoughts and speech are starting to align,
		Conversations are  starting to make a lot more sense. The scattered
		thoughts and memories  puzzle in his head are starting to make a whole
		picture. It is very  promising.
		</p>
		<p>
		Grant should be <a href="http://www.bendigohealth.org.au/ourservices/service,documentid,496.aspx">here</a>
		for the next 5 weeks.
		For those wishing to drop Grant a line or send a little gift,
		the address is as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
		John Lindell Rehabilitation Unit<br>
		100 Barnard St, Bendigo, VIC 3550<br>

		<p class="date">June 19, 2011</p>
		<p>This update is based on the information we are receiving from
		John&nbsp;Sharkey, Grant's friend, who visits Grant in the hospital
		every day.</p>

		<p>The MRI indicates Grant has severe brain damage. The diagnosis is not
		fully clear but the docs say the long term prospects for Grant can be
		very bad. His arms and legs have not moved to this day, however his neck
		is getting stronger, he is moving his head now and focusing his eyes on
		you, not staring aimlessly past you, and even smiles at jokes, but the
		docs say he will never be the same Grant we knew.</p>

		<p><em>Let us support Grant with a little gesture of (Linux) friendship!</em>
		Let us send Grant a postcard or some funny Linux stuff, e.g., Tux.
		Google has lead us to
		<a href="http://www.bytelove.com/">bytelove</a>,
		<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">thinkgeek</a>,
		<a href="http://www.kleargeargeektoys.com/">kleargeargeektoys</a>
		but you will definitely find more.
		For those who finds an opportunity to send
		a gift for Grant, the postal address of the hospital is as follows:</p>

		Attention I.C.U.<br>
		Mr. Grant J. Coady<br>
		Bendigo Health hospital campus<br>

		<p>We are having very sad news today. Earlier this week,
		Grant&nbsp;Coady, a long time AOLS regular, the author and maintainer
		of <a href="http://bugs.id.au">bugs.id.au</a>, and an intelligent, kind
		and open-hearted person, was taken to a hospital in Bendigo (AU) in
		critical condition having some breathing issues. Since then, he
		is at the Intensive Care Unit but his condition does not improve.
		As far as we know, the police has failed to find his relatives, though
		Grant has a sister. Docs at the hospital are short in words.</p>

		<p>The direct line number to the ICU is (03) 5454 7927.</p>

		<p>We are keeping our fingers and hearts crossed. Get back from the
		shadow, Grant, as soon as you are able!</p>

		<p>There's not much to read about Slackware in the Net, and that is why it

		<p><em>Erratum.</em> Just a couple days ago we wrote that <a href="http://workaround.ch/">Slackintosh</a>,
		a port of Slackware to Mac, is not maintained anymore. This is wrong! The -current branch
		of Slackintosh is actively updated by Marco&nbsp;Bonetti since April 2010.</p>

		<!-- ##################################################################### -->
		<p class="date">February 08, 2011</p>
		<p>More news from the past (and one more item in our <a href="./links.html">SlackLinks</a>
		collection)!  This time, this is <a href="http://workaround.ch/">Slackintosh</a>, a port of
		Slackware to Mac, by Adrian&nbsp;Ulrich and Marco&nbsp;Bonetti. Though the port seems to
		be not maintained anymore, its web page is definitely worth visiting, at least for
		taking a look at the <a href="http://workaround.ch/screenshots.html">screenshots</a>.</p>

		<p>We have recently got to know about another distribution inspired by
		Slackware. This time, it is <a href="http://www.dragora.org">Dragora</a>,
		an Argentinian project <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html">blessed</a>
		by the GNU Project as a free GNU/Linux distro. Dragora comes on one CD
		and employs XFCE as its main desktop with only Icewm provided as a
		&quot;lighweight&quot; alternative. It seems to follow the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> principle
		and does its best to provide a single application for each particular
		task. Among apps not currently present in Slackware but included in Dragora,
		one can mention <b>claws-mail</b>, <b>ffmpeg</b>, <b>lame</b>, <b>polipo</b>,
		<b>feh</b>, <b>geany</b>, and <b>epdfview</b>. Mozilla Firefox is
		replaced with Icecat. Interestingly, the directory dedicated to the X.org
		stuff is divided into a number of subdirectories to separate fonts,
		drivers, applications, docs, libraries, etc. We wish you good luck, Dragora!</p>

		<p>Yes, we are slow in publishing &quot;news&quot; but we believe that better
		later than never. Especially when news are good :-)
		</p>
		<p>In late 2010, there appeared a number of reviews of Slackware&nbsp;13.1,
		released in May, 2010. This might seem strange that a review is written
		half a year after the date of the release but all the reviews we found were
		written by people new to Slackware. The reviews are non-technical but they
		are so positive that we decided to list them. They are also interesting
		because they reveal how Slackware is seen from a newbie point of view.</p>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.go2linux.org/mt/linux-ht/2010/11/slackware-review-1.html">first one</a>
		was written by Guillermo&nbsp;Garron and published on November&nbsp;3.
		The author briefly covers different aspects of running Slackware,
		from package management to the release cycle and concludes the review
		by saying &quot;<i>I am new to Slackware but I'm already in love with it</i>&quot; :-)
		In late December, Guillermo&nbsp;Garron writes <a href="http://www.go2linux.org/linux/2010/12/get-slack-878">another post</a>
		on Slackware. This time, it is concluded with the words &quot;<i>If you are curious about Slackware,
		well what can I say? Get Slack!</i>&quot; Amen! :-)</p>
		<p><a href="http://dasublogbyprashanth.blogspot.com/2010/12/review-slackware-131.html">Another review</a>
		was published on December&nbsp;12 by a user who calls himself Prashanth.
      &quot;<i>I had fun working with Slackware and its myriad included
		DEs and WMs, but I could honestly never see myself using Slackware on a
		regular basis and being patient enough to deal with its numerous foibles.</i>&quot;
		OK, at least, this is honest and we hope Prashanth revisits Slackware
		after becoming more familiar with Linux. As a reply to Prashanth, there
		appeared a <a href="http://linux-beginner.blogspot.com/2010/12/dependecy-confessions-from-slacker.html">Dependency-confessions
		from a Slacker</a> by Hannes&nbsp;Worst. Hannes is actually using Slackware&nbsp;12.1.
		This is the end of the &quot;confessions&quot;:
      &quot;<i>There you have it: I started as a slacker and I am still
		being a slacker, because Slackware protects me from myself. The
		package-management of Slackware forces me to think before I act and
		consider my options before and after the installation of software. That's
		why its still stable and usable on my computer after so many years.</i>&quot;
		So, there you have it :-)</p>
		<p>Quite unexpectedly, reading of the above posts lead us to another
		good writeup dedicated to Slackware and published back in 2006. This is
		<a href="http://www.foogazi.com/2006/11/02/7-reasons-i-use-slackware/">7
		Reasons I use Slackware</a> by the maintainer of <a href="http://www.foogazi.com/">Foogazi</a>,
		an interesting site dedicated to &quot;Linux Tips, Tricks, and Opinions.&quot;</p>

		<p>A more advanced reading is <a href="http://studioware.com/wikislax">Quick
		hands-on guide installing an Internet Server on Slackware Linux</a> by Jean-Pierre&nbsp;Menicucci.
		The guide is not a replacement for <a href="http://www.slackbook.org/">The Book</a> but
		contains a number of interesting materials. Finally, another
		interesting reading we failed to mention in time
		is a <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~ddmayne/slackware/ad_integration.html">writeup</a>
		by Douglas&nbsp;Mayne on enabling <a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/">Kerberos</a> support in Slack.</p>
