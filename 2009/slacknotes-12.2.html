 <h2>Slack Notes on Installing and Tuning Slackware-12.2</h2>

 <p>
  <b>Author:</b> Mikhail Zotov
 </p>
 <p>
  Published: March 22, 2009, though actually written in January :-)
 </p>

<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>
I actually didn't plan to install Slackware-12.2.  On my main machine
at work I had a fine-tuned Slackware-11.0, and a fine-tuned Slackware-12.0
at my main machine at home.  Unfortunately, the hard drive on my machine
at work died unexpectedly (do they die "expectedly") a week before 
Slackware-12.2 was released, thus I decided to give it a try.
</p>
<p>
The PCs I have at my disposal are quite old. The newest of them (a 2.2GHz
Pentium-4 on an Intel mobo) was manufactured, I think, around four years
ago.  I have no gadgets to plug in the PCs but USB flash sticks and an
external DVD writer by HP.  My needs at the desktop level are modest,
too. I'm using blackbox-0.65 with a custom theme for years and feel
almost absolutely happy with it [<a href="#almost">*</a>]. 
My favourite file manager is still
Midnight Commander.  Thus, I expect my experience with Slackware won't be
useful for many users.  Anyway,
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Installation went smoothly as usual. I decided to create encrypted root
partition, thus <tt>README_CRYPT.TXT</tt> was my main guide.  I had only a minor
problem at the final stage of setup.  The guide says:
</p>
	<blockquote>
	We are done.  Save your changes, exit the editor and run the command
	<tt>lilo</tt>.  Lilo will issue a couple of warnings concerning a difference in
	what <tt>/proc/partitions</tt> reports and what lilo thinks are the available
	partitions, but it is safe to ignore these.
	</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
In my case, <b>lilo</b> did issue not just a couple of warnings but also a "Fatal" error
complaining about missing <tt>/dev/mapper</tt> devices.  I exited from chroot,
copied necessary files to the destination, entered chroot again. This time,
lilo ran as expected. Voila!
</p>
<p>
One suggestion for those who is going to install Slackware-12.2 on a slow machine.
Don't choose to install gutenprint unless absolutely necessary.  Gutenprint
creates PPD files after installation, and it takes eternity on a slow
machine.  You can add gutenprint when you are up with the installation.
Besides, there are chances you won't need gutenprint at all, see below.
</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<h4>Video</h4>
<p>
The first (and only) serious problem I had with Slackware-12.2 related to
the Intel video driver.  The problem was heavily discussed on AOLS, thus
I will only recall the main point.  The Intel driver ignored settings made
in <tt>xorg.conf</tt> or by other means when working with an old CRT monitor.
Replacing the monitor with a newer model improved the situation but didn't
solve it: I couldn't set the mode I needed.  On the other hand, the driver
worked fine with an LCD monitor I borrowed from my colleague.  The problem
was "fixed" by plugging in an Nvidia card.  Gosh blame Intel&nbsp;dot
</p>

<h4>Printing</h4>
<p>
At work, I have an HP LaserJet 3320 MFU.  It used to work fine with previous releases
of Slackware.  This time, I faced a strange problem when using Gutenprint
driver.  The point is that I often print texts in the two-pages-up mode.
I find this to be handy, e.g., with texts published on the web. I first
print the text in a PostScript file and then rescale and rotate pages using
<b>pstops</b>.  Usually, this works fine. This time, the output was ugly and
hardly readable. Gutenprint complained this way:
</p>
<pre>
   Gutenprint detected a bad color depth (1).  Output quality is degraded.
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
I tried a few setting, the updated gutenprint but this didn't help.
Thus I have chosen a "standard" PostScript driver, and this fixed the problem.
Surely, gutenprint was removed after this.
</p>
<p>
Another printer I'm using every day is a cheah HP LaserJet 1120.  With the stock driver,
it takes around 30 s to print a simple PostScript page. This is obviously
an unacceptable rate.  Luckily, there's <b>foo2zjs</b> that works with this
printer just fine.
</p>

<h4>Networking. I hate udev</h4>
<p>
I have two NICs (three, sometimes) at my main machine at home. One of
them is a built-in Intel card which I want to be eth1. I failed to
"ensure" udev I want it to be this way.  (No, editing
<tt>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</tt> didn't immediately help.) 
Besides, udev used to load the e100 driver for it instead of eepro100,
which I prefer.  Thus I created an ole good /etc/rc.d/rc.netdevice and
used it to load the driver I want.
</p>

<h4>Other stuff</h4>
<p>
Midnight Commander that ships with Slackware-12.2 is buggy. Yes, it is.
The most annoying bug is its inability to honour the "preserve Attributes"
setting when copying/moving files. I have fixed the problem by compiling
and installing <b>mc</b> released back on 2007-01-24.
</p>

<p><em>Later update</em>: Luckily, Midnight commander seems to get the
<a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">second birth</a>.
Version 4.6.2, released in early February, is free from the above mentioned bug.
</p>


<h4>Custom stuff</h4>

<p>
My favourite "all in one" image viewer is <a href="qiv">http://www.klografx.net/qiv/</a>.
It compiled flawlessly but didn't work in Slackware-12.2 producing the following
error message:
</p>
<pre>
   Gdk-ERROR **: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes) serial 108 error_code 8 request_code 2 minor_code 0
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
The problem was fixed by adding <tt>export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1</tt>
to <tt>/etc/profile</tt>.
</p>
<p>Another problem that I had in Slackware-12.2 first appeared in Slackware-11.0
after replacing the 2.4.x kernel with a 2.6 one.  It is often called &quot;Ghost
Users&quot; and is described in details by Michiel v. Wessem 
<a href="http://michielvwessem.wordpress.com/slackware/ghostusers/">here</a>.
I will cite Michiel then to explain the problem:
<blockquote>
   You take one Slackware 11.0 system,  patched and all, installed with
   the 2.6.17.13 default kernel. You boot the system and everything humms
   happily around. You log in and out and do your usual works until, at
   some point you check logged in users and other various user things and
	you see the following output of <b>/usr/bin/last</b>:
<pre>
	root tty2	Thu Jan 18 18:50	gone -- no logout
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's it!  This doesn't happen to root only but also to "mere mortal" users.
I checked and tried everything I found on the subject on the Net but
nothing fixed the problem.  A hint came from Michiel who pointed a seemingly
trivial patch for <b>sysvinit</b>.  The patch didn't work first. After a
slight modification, it solved the problem, and now ghost users are gone :-)
The patch can be downloaded <a href="sysvinit.ghost-user.patch">here</a>.
</p>




<p>
I have added more than a hundred packages to Slackware.  The most of them
migrate from one installation of Slack to another, but still this would be
a daunting task to upgrade all of them without Slackbuilds.org. Thanks men!
</p>
<p>
I do also run a custom kernel.  The first funny problem I had with it looked
this way. <b>Top</b> and other similar tools reported about
</p>
<pre>
   load average: 2.00, 2.00, 2.00
</pre>
<p>
while the processor was actually idle.  The problem was caused by CIFS
compiled into the kernel.  Building it as a module fixed the problem.
</p>

<h4>Open problem</h4>
<p>
From time to time, <b>bbkeys</b> gets mad taking all power of the CPU.
This takes place either when I start <b>blackbox</b> or quit it.
This isn't actually a problem of Slackware-12.2 since I first faced
it with release 11.0. I have no idea why this happens and how this can
be fixed :-(
</p>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
Slackware-12.2 works fine.  Still, for users who, like me, have old
hardware and need few bells and whistles, the latest release hardly
brings any benefits over Slackware-12.0.  In my opinion, this is not the
"fault" of Slackware but the consequence of the way Linux is evolving. 
The kernel team releases a new version of the kernel almost every other
week, including security patches, but few of the new kernel features are
necessary for rank and file users, especially for users of the low-end
hardware.  (Here I mean the 2.6.27 series kernel, which shipped with
Slack-12.2.)
Time one needs to compile a 2.6 kernel is steadily growing,
and is a few times greater than that needed to compile a similar 2.4
kernel.  On the other hand, it is just impossible to compile a 2.4 kernel
with gcc that ships with modern distros (Slackware&gt;12.0 in our case).
</p>
<p id="almost">
[*] Perhaps, I will switch to fluxbox one day. Fluxbox provides a "real"
full-screen mode even for xterm, and I like the feature.  I don't like
the way fluxbox switches between windows though.  Thus, I need to make
sure <b>fbctrl</b> provides the feature I'm missing.
