  <h2>SlackNotes: Analyzing firewall logs with fwlogwatch</h2>

  <p>
   <b>Author:</b> Mikhail Zotov
  </p>
   
  <h3> 
   1. Introduction
  </h3> 

  <p>
   Security seems to be one of the most widely discussed subjects in
   IT-related resources in the web, and the number of programs related
   to computer security is great.  In these notes, I am going to share
   my experience of using <b>fwlogwatch</b> to analyze daily logs of an
   <b>iptables</b> firewall.  Let's begin with an excerpt from the README
   that comes with <b>fwlogwatch</b>:
  </p>

  <blockquote><p>
     <b>fwlogwatch</b> is a security tool written in C by Boris Wesslowski
     originally for RUS-CERT. It is a packet filter/firewall/IDS log
     analyzer with support for a lot of log formats and has many analysis
     options. It also features incident report and realtime response
     capabilities, an interactive web interface and internationalization.
   </p>
   <p>
     It is available at
     <a href="http://fwlogwatch.inside-security.de/">http://fwlogwatch.inside-security.de/</a>
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
   In what follows, version 1.0 of <b>fwlogwatch</b> will be discussed.
   This version is the current one at the moment of this writing.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don't anyhow pretend that the tips discussed below are the best way
   to use <b>fwlogwatch</b>.  This isn't a comprehensive guide on using
   the program either.  <b>fwlogwatch</b> comes with pretty good
   documentation and I suggest that you study it in case you decide to
   give <b>fwlogwatch</b> a try. I just hope that another
   non-professional Linux user (like me) who has his machine on-line for
   many hours every day will find them useful.
  </p>

  <h3> 
   2. Compilation and Installation
  </h3>
  <p>
   These two steps are very easy.  Once again, an excerpt from the README:
  </p>

  <blockquote><p>
     The Makefile assumes you use Linux...
     A simple 'make' should be enough to obtain a working binary...
     'make install' will install the binary (in /usr/local/sbin) and the
     man page, 'make install-config' will also install a sample
     configuration file and template in /etc.
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Everything really comes as described.  Namely, <b>make install</b>
   puts the <b>fwlogwatch</b> binary and two bash scripts
   <tt class="verb">fwlw_notify</tt> and
   <tt class="verb">fwlw_respond</tt>
   in <tt class="verb">/usr/local/sbin</tt> and the man
   page <tt class="verb">fwlogwatch.8</tt> in <tt class="verb">/usr/local/share/man/man8/</tt>.
   In its turn, <b>make install-config</b> puts the default configuration file
   <tt class="verb">fwlogwatch.config</tt> and the default template for incident reports
   <tt class="verb">fwlogwatch.template</tt> in <tt class="verb">/etc</tt>.
  </p>

  <p>
   No libraries that are not present in the Slackware distribution are
   needed for compilation as can be seen from the output of <b>ldd fwlogwatch</b>:
  </p>

  <pre class="listing">
   $ ldd fwlogwatch
         libcrypt.so.1 => /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x40028000)
         libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x40057000)
         libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40068000)
         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)</pre>
  <p>
   <a href="./files/fwlogwatch.SlackBuild">This SlackBuild script</a> can be
   used to compile the program and prepare a Slackware
   package.&nbsp;[<a href="./notes.html#remark1">1</a>]
  </p>

  <h3>
   3. Configuration
  </h3>

  <p>
   The behaviour of <b>fwlogwatch</b> can be controlled both from the configuration
   file and from the command line.  Note though that only those options that
   are <em>not</em> specified explicitly in the configuration file can be changed
   in the command line.  Otherwise, they are just ignored.
  </p>

  <p>
   Let's take a look at <tt class="verb">fwlogwatch.config</tt> which will be used in the examples
   that follow below.  Comments are mostly taken as is from the original file.
  </p>

  <pre class="quest">
# fwlogwatch.config
#
# 'resolve_services' enables lookup of port numbers in /etc/services.
resolve_services = yes

# Input files.
# By default, <b>fwlogwatch</b> analyses /var/log/messages.
#
input = /var/log/syslog

# Use netfilter as a parser (this setting is optional)
#
parser = n

# Activate the protocol and TCP option distinction
#
protocol = on
tcp_opts = on

# A suggested mode of running <b>fwlogwatch</b> to generate reports.
#
run_as = nobody
</pre>

  <p>
   There are many more options that can be set in the configuration file
   but none of them are necessary for the purposes of these notes.
  </p><p>
   Boris Wesslowski suggests to use the <tt class="verb">services</tt>
   file that comes with
   <a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap"><b>nmap</b></a>
   instead of the standard one.  I found this idea pretty
   useful because <b>nmap</b>'s file contains a number of entries
   related to worms and/or trojans.
  </p>

  <h3>
   4. Daily analysis
  </h3>
  <p>
   As a log analyzer, <b>fwlogwatch</b> can write a report to standard output
   (i.e., on the screen) or in a file specified with the "-o" option. The
   first way is especially convenient if one wants to receive reports via
   e-mail.  (In fact, <b>fwlogwatch</b> has the "-T" option, which means that
   the summary must be sent via e-mail but I prefer the `old good' pipe.) 
   In what follows, we will generate three reports by putting the following
   (executable) file in <tt class="verb">/etc/cron.daily</tt>:
  </p>

  <pre class="quest">
#!/bin/bash
# fwlogwatch daily reports
#
# 1.
fwlogwatch -O Sacdda -l 1d -d | mail -s "FWLW: ports" root

# 2.
fwlogwatch -O Sacd -l 1d -n -m3 -D | mail -s "FWLW: hosts + names" root

# 3.
fwlogwatch -O Sacd -l 1d -d | mail -s "FWLW: hosts" root
</pre>

  <p>
   Let us first look at options that appear in all lines that envoke
   <b>fwlogwatch</b>.  The "-O" option specifies the sorting criteria of the
   records in the report.  Explanation given in
   <tt class="verb">fwlogwatch.config</tt> reads:
  </p>

  <pre class="quest">
# Since the sort algorithm used is stable you can sort several times,
# entries that are equal for the primary criteria will be sorted by the
# next criteria. The sort string can be composed of 11 fields of the
# form 'ab' where 'a' is the sort criteria:
#
# c count
# t start time
# e end time
# z duration
# n target name
# p protocol
# b byte count
# S source host
# s source port
# D destination host
# d destination port
#
# and 'b' the order:
#
# a ascending
# d descending
#
# Sorting is done in the given sequence, so the last option is
# the primary criteria.</pre>
  <p>
   For the first report, we use the "-O Sacdda" option to sort results. The
   last pair of letters ("da") means that all entries in the report will be
   first sorted by the destination port number ("d"), in the ascending
   order ("a"), i.e., from port number&nbsp;0 up to port 65535.  Next, the
   "cd" pair defines (and this will take place for the other two reports)
   that entries will be sorted according to the count number ("c") (i.e.,
   the number of appearances of the respective record in <tt class="verb">syslog</tt>) in the
   descending order ("d"), i.e., the most `active' entries will be listed
   first.  Finally, the "Sa" pair defines that entries which are equivalent
   in the sence of the previous criteria will be sorted in the ascending
   order ("a") of the IP addresses of source hosts&nbsp;("S").
  </p><p>
   Another option that appears in all commands is "-l&nbsp;1d".  It tells
   <b>fwlogwatch</b> to ignore entries older than 1&nbsp;day.  It can be specified in
   <tt class="verb">fwlogwatch.config</tt> as "recent = 1d" but I put it here because it is
   sometimes useful to generate reports for longer periods of time, e.g.,
   weekly or bi-weekly reports.&nbsp;[<a href="./notes.html#remark2">2</a>]
  </p><p>
   Now, it's time to look what <b>fwlogwatch</b> can do for us.  Below, I will
   use excerpts from real reports generated by an analysis of a day in the
   life of a small firewall/router.  By obvious reasons, IP addresses of
   destination hosts will be replaced by "A.B.C.#".  `Researchers' will be
   listed as is.&nbsp;:-)
  </p>

  <h3>
   4.1 Ports
  </h3>
  <p>
   Recall that the first report is generated by the command
  </p>

  <pre class="listing">
   fwlogwatch -O Sacdda -l 1d -d</pre>
  <p>
   and begins with lower ports.  The "-d" option specifies that we want
   to differentiate destination ports.  Below come a number of excerpts
   from the report.  (It is clearly seen that entries are sorted in the
   desired order.)
  </p><p>
   First, one can see connection attempts to ftp, ssh and telnet ports:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 66.97.95.1 to A.B.C.18 port 21 (ftp) SYN
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 66.97.95.1 to A.B.C.1 port 21 (ftp) SYN

   eth0 2 tcp packets from 213.161.3.127 to A.B.C.52 port 23 (telnet) SYN
   ...</pre>
  <p>
   to the nameserver port:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">

   eth0 1 tcp packet from 213.145.46.52 to A.B.C.21 port 42 (nameserver) SYN
   ...</pre>
  <p>
   to the www port:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">

   eth0 1 tcp packet from 203.98.177.86 to A.B.C.15 port 80 (http) SYN
   ...</pre>
  <p>
   a number of MS-specific ports:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 213.82.111.186 to A.B.C.62 port 135 (msrpc) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 213.82.111.186 to A.B.C.59 port 135 (msrpc) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 213.82.111.186 to A.B.C.44 port 135 (msrpc) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 213.82.111.186 to A.B.C.33 port 135 (msrpc) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 213.82.111.186 to A.B.C.52 port 135 (msrpc) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 213.82.111.186 to A.B.C.60 port 135 (msrpc) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.192.7.9 to A.B.C.40 port 139 (netbios-ssn) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.192.7.9 to A.B.C.30 port 139 (netbios-ssn) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.192.7.9 to A.B.C.38 port 139 (netbios-ssn) -a-r--</pre>
  <p>
   and so on.  The report ends up with entries corresponding to connection
   attempts to higher ports:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 221.208.157.38 to A.B.C.28 port 19116 (-) sa----
   eth0 2 tcp packets from 143.248.239.240 to A.B.C.1 port 32772 (sometimes-rpc7) SYN
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 143.248.239.240 to A.B.C.18 port 32772 (sometimes-rpc7) SYN
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 143.248.239.240 to A.B.C.18 port 32772 (sometimes-rpc7) ---r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 143.248.239.240 to A.B.C.1 port 32772 (sometimes-rpc7) ---r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 143.248.239.240 to A.B.C.58 port 32772 (sometimes-rpc7) ---r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 221.188.190.51 to A.B.C.3 port 33361 (-) SYN
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 221.208.157.38 to A.B.C.57 port 36948 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 221.208.157.38 to A.B.C.2 port 38421 (-) sa----</pre>

  <p>
   In the end of each line corresponding to a TCP packet (actually, all
   packets listed above), SYN, ACK, RST (and possibly other) header bits
   are shown.  Such a report is probably not necessary for a daily analysis
   but it can be handy at the stage of preliminary tuning of your firewall
   rules when you want to silently drop connection attempts that are
   irrelevant for your machine or LAN.  Besides, it helps to notice when
   another MS worm appears and begins to fill <tt class="verb">syslog</tt> with `noise'.
  </p>
  <h3>
   4.2 Hosts with names
  </h3>
  <p>
   The second report (generated with the "fwlogwatch -O Sacd -l 1d -n -m3 -D"
   command) can be more interesting.  Here, DNS lookups are enabled ("-n").
   In order to reduce the number of DNS lookups we limit their number by
   `researchers' who were logged at least three times ("-m3").  In
   addition, we will not differentiate destination hosts ("-D") because we
   are going to find `researchers' who were the most active to scan our
   LAN.
  </p><p>
   The report begins with hosts with the biggest number of records in
   <tt class="verb">syslog</tt>:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 30 tcp packets from 66.225.253.145 (unknown.ord.scnet.net) sa----
   eth0 12 tcp packets from 204.202.12.175 (makeland.co.jp) sa----</pre>
  <p>
   We have already seen this host hitting port 135:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 6 tcp packets from 213.82.111.186 (-) -a-r--</pre>
  <p>
   and this one hitting port 42:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 12.5.228.40 (okmls.com) SYN</pre>
  <p>
   Next come a couple of other `researchers':
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 66.89.116.66 (w066.z066089116.den-co.dsl.cnc.net) SYN
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 66.97.95.1 (w1.bmi.net) SYN</pre>
  <p>
   As we could see earlier, the latter one `investigated' the ftp port.
   And this one `studied' www ports:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 131.172.30.71 (moodle.fhu.latrobe.edu.au) SYN</pre>
  <p>
   This one tried to study us in two different ways, namely with the SYN and
   RST bits set:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 143.248.239.240 (wlan-card-1-121.kaist.ac.kr) SYN
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 143.248.239.240 (wlan-card-1-121.kaist.ac.kr) ---r--</pre>

  <p>
   This one `touched' port 139 with only ACK and RST bits set in the headers
   of its TCP packets:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 216.192.7.9 (sfr-tgn-sfe-vty9.as.wcom.net) -a-r--</pre>

  <p>
   Finally, this one examined higher ports of our machines with packets that
   had only SYN and ACK bits set:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 3 tcp packets from 221.208.157.38 (-) sa----</pre>
  <p>
   In this case, <b>fwlogwatch</b> didn't find a name of the host, as well as in
   the case of host 213.82.111.186 above.  This is indicated by "(-)" after
   host's IP address.
  </p>
  <h3>
   4.3 Hosts with more details
  </h3><p>
   The third report ("fwlogwatch -O Sacd -l 1d -d") contains the same
   information as the first one but it is not ordered with respect to
   destination ports and can be handy when a `researcher' `studies'
   different ports of our machines. For example, the following entries
   allow us to see activities of makeland.co.jp at once:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.61 port 1024 (kdm) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.16 port 3072 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.11 port 3072 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.45 port 3072 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.26 port 3072 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.6 port 3072 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.31 port 1024 (kdm) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.35 port 3072 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.28 port 3072 (-) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.19 port 1024 (kdm) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.4 port 1024 (kdm) sa----
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 204.202.12.175 to A.B.C.39 port 3072 (-) sa----</pre>

  <p>
   With the "-s" option, we can find that makeland.co.jp used port&nbsp;22 (ssh)
   as its source port.  A treacherous guy, isn't he?&nbsp;;-)
  </p>
  <h3>
   5. What's more?
  </h3><p>
   There are many more options supported by <b>fwlogwatch</b>.  Please, check its
   man page, the README file, and the default <tt class="verb">fwlogwatch.config</tt>.  Besides,
   options can be combined so that one can have in one entry, say, both
   source and destination ports, timestamp of the first and/or the last packet,
   etc.  I didn't use a big number of options to prepare reports considered
   above because the more options you add the longer respective entries can
   become.  This sometimes makes a report hardly readable.
  </p><p>
   Above, we have looked at three different ways to generate daily reports.
   It can be convenient to make a weekly report.  This can be accomplished,
   e.g., this way:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   fwlogwatch -O Sacd -l 7d -D -m10 -n | mail -s "FWLW weekly report" root</pre>

  <p>
   if the command is run just before the moment <tt class="verb">syslog</tt> is rotated.
   If this is not the case, or you want to have a report for a longer
   period, add the names of necessary files to the command line.
   (I assume that <tt class="verb">syslog</tt> is rotated once a week as it takes place 
   in the default installation of Slackware.)
  </p><p>
   As it should be clear from the above discussion, the last command
   tells  <b>fwlogwatch</b> to consider entries that appeared in <tt class="verb">syslog</tt> during
   last seven days ("-l 7d"), to ignore destination IP addresses ("-D"), to
   ignore hits that appeared less than 10 times (-m10) during the week, and
   to perform DNS lookups ("-n").  In our case, it reveals that at least two
   of the the `researchers' listed above were more active than we could judge
   basing on a one day report:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 33 tcp packets from 66.225.253.145 (unknown.ord.scnet.net) sa----
   eth0 15 tcp packets from 221.208.157.38 (-) sa----</pre>

  <p>
   All in all, I find <b>fwlogwatch</b> to be a convenient tool for the analysis
   of entries made in <tt class="verb">syslog</tt> by
   <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/"><b>netfilter</b></a>.
   Unfortunately, the program
   lacks an option that can be handy when your LAN is `studied' by a
   `prudent' `researcher'.  Consider the folowing excerpt from the third
   report:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.11 to A.B.C.40 port 4974 (-) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.11 to A.B.C.36 port 1846 (-) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.14 to A.B.C.40 port 4999 (-) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.25 to A.B.C.5 port 3615 (-) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.25 to A.B.C.36 port 2071 (-) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.26 to A.B.C.15 port 1182 (-) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.27 to A.B.C.40 port 1048 (-) -a-r--
   eth0 1 tcp packet from 216.10.118.28 to A.B.C.36 port 2056 (-) -a-r--</pre>

  <p>
   Each of these hosts made at most two `touches' of our machines, so that
   we didn't notice them in the second report.  In addition, all `touches'
   used different destination ports, so that it was difficult to notice
   them in the first report.  (Interestingly, all connection attempts
   originated from port&nbsp;80, i.e., the http port.)  Happily, our reports are
   sorted with respect to source IP addresses and thus these entries appear
   in the report one by one.  In my opinion, it could be handy if
   <b>fwlogwatch</b> had an option that allowed one to group entries originated
   from the same subnet.  Admittedly, a more `prudent' `researcher' or a
   group of `researchers' can employ machines from different networks for
   their `investigation' but this seems to be a (bit) more complicated
   task.

   <b>fwlogwatch</b> can be used in a number of other ways.  For example, it can
   operate in real time mode and modify ipchains/iptables rules on the
   fly.  It can even automatically send abuse reports.  These applications
   of the program are out of the scope of the present Slack Notes.

  <h4>
   Remarks
  </h4>
  <p>
   [<a id="remark1">1</a>] 
   In fact, <b>fwlogwatch</b> supports i18n but I didn't bother with this in
   the build script.
  </p>
  <p>
   [<a id="remark2">2</a>] 
   In order to obtain correct daily reports with the above script,
   one has to make sure that at the day log files are rotated, the script
   is run just before rotation.  Otherwise, <b>fwlogwatch</b> will read 
   incomplete file.  In order to avoid such situation, one may want to
   include "input = /var/log/syslog.1" in the configuration file.
