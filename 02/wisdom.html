  </p>

  <p>
   I laughed when I read that...  then I read the answers you are
   getting.  Seems I was naive to think the questions were naive.
  </p><p>
   First, the "everything is a file" is not a Linux concept, but
   rather was inherent in UNIX right from the beginning, where it
   was indeed a new idea.  Your concept of what a "file" is, is too
   limited!  (Which is one reason for the confusion.)
  </p><p>
   An Operating System provides services to "user" applications,
   and the idea behind "everything is a file" is to make the
   application's interface to everything just the same as if it
   were a file rather than implementing a totally distinct set of
   functions for each and every type of interface, which is exactly
   the way OS's were written prior to UNIX.
  </p><p>
   For example, we have an OS that provides "system calls" (in the
   C programming language the functions in Section 2 of the man
   pages access those services), and for files we have a basic set
   of functions (e.g., open(), read(), write(), lseek() and
   close()) to allow programs to manipulate files.  That is the
   interface the creators of UNIX wanted to use for everything.
   (They did not succeed immediately in doing so, but modern unix
   OS's pretty much do, with a few exceptions.)
  </p><p>
   What's all that mean?  Well, if we have a printer or a modem, we
   want to be able do IO using those open/read/write/close
   functions!  There are other things too...  networks, pipes,
   buffers, and for that matter processes themselves as well as the
   kernel itself, which can be accessed using the "file interface"!
  </p><p>
   That works because there are many types of "files" and while at
   the application programming level we rarely are ever much
   concerned with different file types, inside the kernel each of
   those functions that deal with files are actually doing very
   different things for each different type of file.  Hence if
   your applications program wants input from a FIFO, from a disk
   file, and from a modem, the way the read() function is used is
   identical...  but inside the kernel what happens is totally
   different.  The read() function has the same name, but it
   executes different code for each of those "files".  The whole
   point of the UNIX concept of "everything is a file" is to hide
   that difference from application programmers and users.
  </p><p>
   Whenever you do an ls command using the -l option you see a
   display that shows the file type as part of the string that also
   shows the permissions.   The man page for ls says (reformatted
   for emphasis):
  </p><pre class="listing">
      "The file types are as follows:

            -   for an ordinary file,
            d   for a directory,
            b   for a block special device,
            c   for a character special device,
            l   for a symbolic link,
            p   for a fifo,
            s   for a socket."
  </pre><p>
   OK?  Now you can see that the kernel uses "file" system calls to
   do several different things, depending on what "type" of file.
  </p><p>
   One of those things is access to hardware via "device special"
   files, the "b" and "c" types in the list above.  Generally
   device special files are all kept in the /dev directory, and a
   quick check there shows how diverse this "everything is a file"
   concept has gotten!  We can access the computer's memory, every
   hardware device from hard disks to printers, and a bazillion
   other things, in an application by using the same functions that
   are used to access just an "ordinary file".
  </p><p>
   Prior to UNIX, it was much more likely that an OS would provide
   a different system call for each type of device; which means
   each of the "major" device numbers used by device special files
   in /dev would probably have had a totally separate function for
   each of read(), write() and so on.  It worked fine to begin
   with, but obviously would be way out of hand by today!
  </p><p>
   So that is what a "device" is!  It is the magic hidden inside
   the kernel to allow one universal, simplified, method of access
   to anything for input/output.  It is the part of the kernel
   which decides what the read() function, for example, will
   actually do when called for that particular file.  A "device
   driver" is the code to provide the functionality.  It extends the
   kernel's list of "file types" by providing a "file interface" for
   any given hardware.
  </p><p>
   Hence you can only call read() on /dev/xyz if there is a
   "driver" in the kernel for an xyz.  And of course the driver
   must actually find whatever hardware it is supposed to
   communicate with too.
  </p><p>
   On to "mountpoint"...
  </p><p>
   Directories are one of those "different" types of files too.
   And a mount point is nothing other than a directory!
  </p><p>
   A mount point is a directory that is arbitrarily used as the
   place where a "filesystem" is attached to the directory tree.
   But there is nothing special about it, as any directory can be
   used as a mount point.
  </p><p>
   A "filesystem" is just more kernel magic used to hide messy
   details from application level programming.  It usually provides
   a standardized view of "files" available on some storage device,
   but for example sometimes it provides a view of "files"
   (information) available from the kernel!
  </p><p>
   Regardless, the "mount" system call attaches the filesystem to
   the directory tree, which makes those "files" available via the
   interface discussed above.  A filesystem can be mounted on any
   directory, and any directory that has a filesystem mounted on it
   is then called a "mount point".
  </p><p>
   Now, consider two ideas...
  </p><p>
   If you have a directory which contains a list of files available
   on one storage device, what happens if you then mount another
   filesystem on that particular directory?  Can you access the
   files that were available prior to mounting the new filesystem?
   Are they still there?  Hmmmm...  (Try it!)
  </p><p>
   But another idea is actually much more interesting!  The
   "everything is a file" concept actually means "everything that
   is local to this computer is a file".  Things that are networked
   don't fit quite so well, though certainly even that is partially
   interfaced as a "file".  (Networks aren't well adapted, but
   network connections, once they are set up, are.)  So...  what if
   the paradigm is change to "everything is a network"?  The same
   people who came up with "everything is a file" have also spent a
   couple decades or so researching the concept of viewing
   everything as a network too.

  </p><p>
   Device files, special files or nodes of the filesystem are names
   through which character and/or block devices are accessed. The kernel
   associates a major number, a 16-bit number as far as the 2.4 series
   kernels are concerned, with a device driver which provides mechanisms
   (and sometimes policies) that implement open, read, write, release,
   ioctl, and other functions which access the physical device attached.
   Device's or its driver's name is ignored by the kernel.
  </p><p>
   The minor number of a device driver is something the kernel doesn't
   need, nor use; it merely passes this value along to the driver.
   Within the driver, however, the minor number is used to distinguish
   among various instances of the same device having the same major
   number (and any name).
  </p><p>
   In a strict sense, the kernel doesn't read and write information from
   and to devices. It only provides raw resources to the devices'
   drivers, which in turn provide mechanisms that are used to access the
   device.

  <p>
   It depends on your needs and how stable you want your system.
  </p><p>
   I like to use partitions for directories that should be protected during
   regular system use (i.e. /boot) or that I want to save if I have to reinstall
   the system (i.e. /usr/local and /home). But, this plan might not suit you.
  </p><p>
   Here's a list that I've compiled showing the reasons to partition. I'm sure
   that a rebuttal will soon be posted in reply :-)&nbsp;[<a href="./wisdom.html#remark1">1</a>]
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Why partition? There are many reasons:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Make intellegent use of disk space by reserving space for future expansion
   of your filesystems</li>

   <li>To perform optimization of disk access resources by placing heavily used
   disk resources closer to optimum seek point of the disk</li>

   <li>To impose restrictions on the size of certain directory subtrees (i.e. /tmp
   or /var/spool/lpd) to ensure that they do not grow beyond certain preset sizes.</li>
  
   <li>To facilitate backup and recovery by enabling volume backups as well as
   directory tree/subtree backups</li>

   <li>To reduce the time taken by the boot up filesystem check, by reducing the
   amount of filesystem checked at any one time, and by permitting the filesystem
   check to parallelize it's operations.</li>

   <li>To facilitate upgrades by ensuring that the upgrade process doesn't delete
   or reformat certain directory subtrees (like /home or /var/spool/news) as part
   of the installation/upgrade process</li>

   <li>To restrict online access to certain directory subtrees (i.e. the boot
   partition ) by ensuring that they are mounted "read-only" or not mounted at
   all when they are not needed.</li>

   <li>To provide alternate (or recovery) directory subtrees, by offering offline
   space for image archives of critical directory subtrees, or by providing space
   for alternate versions of the directory subtrees (i.e. a "recovery" root fs)</li>

   <li>To provide alternate filesystem formatting (journal fs vs unjournaled fs),
   to meet the needs of the use of the filesystem (i.e. use journalling
   filesystems where recovery is required (like / or /home), and non-journalling
   filesystems where recovery is unnecessary (like /tmp or /var/tmp).</li>

   <li>To provide alternate filesystem blocksizes (1K, 4K, etc) to meet the needs
   of the use of the filesystem (i.e. smaller blocksizes for filesystems that
   store many small files vs larger blocksizes for filesystems that store large
   files).</li>

  <p>
   Here is what Pat says about aaa_elflibs (slightly edited) some time ago.
   I hope this helps explain the purpose of aaa_elflibs and answers the
   question of why it should not be upgraded.
  </p><p>
   [..]
   Of course, aaa_elflibs (kludgey as it is) contains a few nuggets that
   really aren't found anywhere else.  I've also been meaning to warn
   people that if they see a new aaa_elflibs released that upgrading to it
   is a REALLY DUMB IDEA. The aaa_ packages are intended for one time
   installation (though reinstalling aaa_base is a lot safer than
   reinstalling aaa_elflibs). aaa_elflibs is mostly to provide a net for
   people who would otherwise install a functionally incomplete system to
   cut down on the amount of help people need if they do not install
   required packages.  It  wouldn't be such a bad package except that some
   projects (like, say CUPS, or ALSA) don't tend to increment library
   versions when they release new ones, so ancient ones in aaa_elflibs get
   copied over new ones, and things begin to mysteriously fail.  Fun, huh?
  </p><p>
   I've been meaning to look at a solution, but previous attempts like
   staging libraries from /lib/incoming and considering if they should be
   installed had other problems.  A nice side effect of the filename
   collisions is that having something listed in aaa_elflibs also prevents
   removing the newer library when people run around removing things at
   random so they can have 60GB free instead of 59GB ;-)
  </p><p>
   Continued a bit
   <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.slackware/msg/13028c03dbb7aaaf?hl=en">later</a>:
  </p><p>
   Oh, and to answer the question about why it is not in UPGRADE.TXT:
   if you're upgrading every package in the OS, then there is no need
   to worry about aaa_elflibs because its library versions are identical to
   those contained within the main packages.
  </p><p>
   For example:
  </p><pre class="listing">
   turrican [a] # tar ztvvf aaa_elflibs-10.1.0-i486-1.tgz | grep curses.so
   -rwxr-xr-x root/root    253584 2005-01-24 17:02:29 lib/libncurses.so.5.4
   turrican [a] # tar ztvvf ../l/ncurses-5.4-i486-2.tgz|grep curses.so
   -rwxr-xr-x root/root    253600 2004-02-17 23:22:33 lib/libncurses.so.5.4
   turrican [a] #</pre>
  <p>
   This is why it is not mentioned in the UPGRADE.TXT.
  </p><p>
   A short while ago, elflibs was renamed to aaa_elflibs (the name it now
   has) so that it would always be installed prior to any other packages.
   This was so that if you were installing Slackware-current then you
   wouldn't run into the situation in the following example:
  </p><p>
    a/aaa_elflibs contains bzip2 libraries from a/bzip2
    Because the packages are installed according to their alphabetic precedence,
    it meant that bzip2 would be installed first.  Remembering that aaa_elblibs
    (or 'elflibs' as it was called previously) was only updated right before
    a new release of Slackware, you run into the problem, or run the risk that
    the installation goes like this:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li> a/bzip2 is installed -- this is the very latest bzip2</li>
      <li> more packages installed...</li>
      <li> elflibs package is installed
        This package has not been updated since the last release of Slackware
        it contains ancient libraries -- including an old copy of bzip2's .so.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
   It was renamed 'aaa_elflibs' to work around this problem.
   This also explains why you should not upgradepkg aaa_elflibs without 
   also upgrading the entire OS.

  <p>
   this is just make telling you what it's doing. you've probably run make
   before, and didn't do `make clean' so the object files created on the first
   run are still there. therefore make has nothing to do in those
   directories.
  </p><pre class="quest">

   now make has entered a directory where it does have to do stuff. nice thing
   about make: it tells you exactly what it's doing, i.e. which commands it
   runs, and it doesn't hide any of the output those commands give. so:
  </p><pre class="quest">

  <p>
   this is the command that make is executing. it's calling guile. guile, in
   case you don't know, is an embedable(sp) interpreter for the scheme
   language. scheme, in case you don't know, is a dialect of the most
   brilliant programming language known to man, lisp. now, guile isn't quite
   happy. you can tell, because it's spitting out what you're trying to give

   this is a backtrace from guile. a backtrace just shows you what the
   interpreter has been doing just before it encountered an error. that info
   may help to determine what the cause of the error was, although in this
   case it's not really necessary.

   now guile is reporting the actual error. it seems that it is looking for a
   file slib/require.scm that it cannot find. slib, FYI, is the scheme
   library, which (i assume, i'm not actually familiar with scheme) is similar
   to libc, the C library. i suspect that you haven't installed it, because
   FWIU it is a separate package and doesn't come with guile.
  </p><pre class="quest">
> make[2]: *** [gw-standard.c] Error 2
> make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/user/downloads/g-wrap-1.3.4/g-wrap'
> make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

> make: *** [all] Error 2</pre><p>
   this is just make giving you an error count, and telling you in which
   target and in which nested level the error(s) occurred. note that make can
   call itself, and when make[2] encounters an error, it breaks off and tells
   make[1] by which it was called about this. make[1] then also breaks
   off. so it looks like you're seeing two errors, but in reality you're
   seeing one error that's being reported twice.
  </p><p>
   one important thing to keep in mind with this sort of thing (this is
   magical hint #1 ;-) ): read the *entire* error message and try to grok what
   it says. don't just skip it because you don't understand the first line. a
   phrase like "Could not find slib/require.scm" should be pretty
   self-evident, even if you haven't got the foggiest what that backtrace is
   all about.
  </p><p>
   and now for magical hint #2: a google search for that missing file
   would have led you to 
   <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-user/2003-June/007075.html">this post</a>
   which is a reply to someone with exactly your problem, giving the
   solution. (which, BTW, indicates my suspicion above was correct.)
  </p><p>
   anyways, i don't know if the problems you have compiling other programs
   also relate to guile/slib, but if not, try the method i suggested, using
   the info i provided on how the output of make is structured. read the error
   messages carefully, looking for anything that you understand, and try to
   find something that may lead to a successful google search. if nothing
   turns up, go to the program's home page, see if there is a mailing list
   (there usually is) and search the archives. if that still doesn't yield
   anything useful, consider posting to the list. it's usually (though
   admittedly not always...) a better place to ask questions that are related
   to a specific program.

   No problem Jon to answer that, and it's a good question that probably many
   need to know the answer to. Thanks for asking !!
  </p><p>
   Even when there are no "known vulnerabilities" or "published exploits" --
   of which there are very many (that probably most people are not
   immediately aware), even then, ...
  </p><p>
   When you run as an unpriveledged (normal) user, then any vulnerability or
   exploit (search zero day exploit) that may be deployed against the
   application, and which succeeds in running "arbitrary code", only gets to
   run that arbitrary code in the priviledges of the user that was running
   the application. If the user is not allowed to (does not have ownership
   of) writing system files, then, in order to compromise the system, the
   attacker must then deploy a second vulnerability exploit before s/he can
   escalate the priveledge (ownership) to change system files (much, much
   more difficult).
  </p><p>
   If you run as root, whoever gets in, gets everything, right off. Very bad
   strategy if it can be avoided. It can be avoided by running as a normal
   user.
  </p><p>
   I don't think whois has a vulnerability. If it doesn't, then there is no
   problem. But whois will run as a normal user and as such should always
   <em>be</em> run as a normal user. If in fact there were a vulnerability in
   whois, for example, or an exploit for the (hypothetical) vulnerability,
   then whomever did exploit it ( the dirty criminal!!) could access the
   system with the rights of whoever called the process. And a normal user
   doesn't have system rights, whereas root does.
