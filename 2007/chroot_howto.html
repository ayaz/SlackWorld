<h2>A How To on Creating a chroot Environment</h2>

<p> The <b>chroot</b> program, <b>man chroot</b> for details, enables us
to run different instances of the GNU/Linux environment on a single
system simultaneously without rebooting. There could be many reasons why
one would want or need to do this so doing it securely is a Good Thing(c)
right? Do it in a way that does not disrupt ones running installation is
surely the Right Thing(c) to do. In this document I will show you exactly
how to achieve these stated aims whilst having fun at the same time.</p>

<p> In this document I shall be showing you how you can run, for testing
purposes perhaps, two versions of Slackware simultaneously. Both will be
fully fledged installs and both will be fully usable. It is possible to
run other distributions via this method as well but I shall leave that
aim as an exercise for the reader. Once you know how it is done then
doing it for alternative distributions is a natural progression of your
newly acquired skills.</p>

<p> It is also possible to run the Slackware tool set under the
<b>chroot</b> of a fast host while NFS-mounting a slower machine on the
network to the host as read/write and the <b>chroot</b> point being the
mount point of the slower machine.</p>

<p> But for this mini How To I shall concentrate on implementing a
<b>chroot</b> on a single host.</p>

<h3>Slackware within chroot</h3>

<p> A <b>chroot</b> Slackware environment is not a hard thing to do. We
must be careful however that we do not affect our main install. We must
also determine what we want from the <b>chroot</b> environment as this
will affect what we install with it. Do we just want a basic CLI
environment? Do we want a CLI with network environment? Do we want a full
blown environment with X&nbsp;+ DTE/WM (Desktop Environment&nbsp;+ Window
manager)? The list of possibilities can be a long one. For the purposes
of this document however we shall go with a CLI&nbsp;+ Network
environment. Once this foundation is laid we can expand on it once we are
within the <b>chroot</b> just like any normal install of Slackware.</p>

<p> Everything we do for the <b>chroot</b> will have to be done as the
root user at first. This is because we need to use Slackware's own
pkgtools. Plus, we want to ensure whatever we install has the correct
permissions and user attributes. First we must decide where our
<b>chroot</b> environment will be. For this document we will use
<tt class="verb">/mnt/chroot</tt>. That directory will probably not exist
so create it:</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # mkdir -p /mnt/chroot</pre>

<p> Next we install the basic environment. For the following to work we
will need to <b>cd</b> to wherever your local slacktree resides. There is
bash script at the end of this document that will download the slackpaks
for you and install these if you do not have a local copy of the
Slackware Install tree. For example my own local Slackware tree resides
on <tt class="verb">/mnt/sources/slackware-11.0</tt> so, we would
<b>cd</b> to there before installing the basic package set. Let us
install our basic setup which we have decided is CLI&nbsp;+ Network. This
means we need to install packages of series a, ap, l and n. For the sake
of simplicity, we install all of these series. If your local Slackware
tree resides on a CD-ROM then make sure you have it mounted and that you
<b>cd</b> into the relevant directory before doing the <b>installpkg</b>
lines below.</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # cd /mnt/sources/slackware-11.0/slackware # Edit to suit.
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot a/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot ap/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot l/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot n/*.tgz</pre>

<p> Next we will copy the local <tt class="verb">hosts</tt> file and the local
<tt class="verb">fstab</tt> file to our <b>chroot</b> environment. This will enable us to
have the local network work within our <b>chroot</b> environment and also allow
all local devices to be used within our <b>chroot</b>:</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # cp /etc/hosts /mnt/chroot/etc/hosts
slackbox # cp /etc/fstab /mnt/chroot/etc/fstab</pre>

<p> Copying your main system <tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt> may or may not be
required, depending on how your main system and the <b>chroot</b> environment
are setup. For example, if you have a multiple partition setup on your
main system then unless you have setup the <b>chroot</b> environment exactly the
same then copying <tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt> is not required. In this case you
should manually create (or copy then edit)
<tt class="verb">/mnt/chroot/etc/fstab</tt>. If, however, you have a simple
partition layout then copying <tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt> to
<tt class="verb">/mnt/chroot/etc/fstab</tt> will be okay.</p>

<p> At this stage we have a fully functioning Slackware install within
our <b>chroot</b> environment so now we shall <b>chroot</b> into it.
Before we do that we have a little magic to do to ensure it works as
expected:</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # mount -o bind /proc /mnt/chroot/proc
slackbox # mount -o bind /dev /mnt/chroot/dev
slackbox # chroot /mnt/chroot /bin/bash</pre>

<p> By binding the running system, our main system, <tt class="verb">/proc</tt> and
<tt class="verb">/dev</tt> we ensure that all connected hardware works in our
<b>chroot</b>. If, however, you have installed the Slackware <tt class="verb">dev</tt>
package you may not need to bind <tt class="verb">/dev</tt> to
<tt class="verb">/mnt/chroot/dev</tt>. Your Mileage May Vary on this particular
thing.</p>

<p> It is worth noting that if you decide to (re)build a <b>chroot</b>
kernel and if it is a different version from your main systems kernel
then you may run into incompatibily problems when you bind <tt class="verb">/proc</tt>
to <tt class="verb">/mnt/chroot/proc</tt>. To maintain stability and compatibilty I
recommend that unless you know precisely what you are doing and that you
know precisely what issues can happen and how to get around those issues
then you do not build a kernel within your <b>chroot</b>. That said, for
the more technically inclined amongst you, if you do decide or want to
test vastly differing kernels within your <b>chroot</b> then do not do the
<tt class="verb">/proc</tt> binding line above but instead do the following line once
you are within your <b>chroot</b>:

<pre class="listing">
chroot-1 # mount -t proc none /proc</pre>

<p> Mounting <tt class="verb">/proc</tt> is this manner may also remove the need to
issue <b>startx&nbsp;--&nbsp;:1</b> when we setup our X environment later
in this how to.</p>

<p> The first thing you should do once you are sat within your chroot is to
ensure libraries, and if using X, fonts are available.</p>

<pre class="listing">
chroot-1 # ldconfig</pre>

<p> And for fonts do:</p>

<pre class="listing">
chroot-1 # fc-cache</pre>

<p> You are now sat on your newly created chrooted Slackware install.</p>

<p> What can we do now? Well, how about give your <b>chroot</b> environment a
hostname other than darkstar?</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # cp /etc/HOSTNAME /mnt/chroot/etc/</pre>

<p> The above line will give your <b>chroot</b> the same hostname as your
main environment. Not everyone wants this so make the change permanent in
<tt class="verb">/mnt/chroot/etc/rc.d/rc.M</tt> by editing the <b>hostname</b> line in
that file. Next time you login to your <b>chroot</b>, your <b>chroot</b>
will now have its very own name.</p>

<p> If you have followed this document from the beginning then what you
have created is a fully functioning Slackware install within which you
can do anything you like without infecting your main Slackware
installation. To exit from a chroot jail simply type `<b>exit</b>'. Once
you have typed that and hit &lt;Enter&gt; you will be back on your main
environment.</p>


<p> Typing <b>chroot /mnt/chroot /bin/bash</b> is all well and good but
this could create all sorts of problems further down the line. It is much
better to start another login process where you can login to the
<b>chroot</b> directly and ensure the environment is clean.</p>

<p> On a typical Slackware setup tty1 through tty6 are linux consoles.
Xorg typically runs on the first available one counting from tty1 up
until it finds the first free one which will be tty7 on a typical
Slackware install so it is safe for us to use tty8:</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # echo "c7:1235:respawn:/usr/bin/chroot /mnt/chroot "\
           "/sbin/agetty 38400 tty8" >>/etc/inittab
slackbox # init q                           # This reloads init</pre>

<p> Now whenever you press ALT-F8 (from console) or CTRL-ALT-F8 (from
within X) your <b>chroot</b> environment will be launched if not started
or you will rejoin it if it is.</p>


<h3>Setting up X for chroot</h3>

<p> Running X with KDE or Gnome2 or WindowMaker within your <b>chroot</b>
is entirely possible.</p>

<p> First we should install the packages and copy our working
<tt>Xorg.conf</tt> from our main environment to our chrooted one:</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot x/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot xap/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot kde/*.tgz
slackbox # cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /mnt/chroot/etc/X11/xorg.conf</pre>

<p> If you use GDM, KDM or XDM then we should edit those to reflect the
<b>chroot</b>. Because you are likely to have X running already GDM, KDM
and friends will have to be started on another free Virtual terminal. My
own preference is to type <b>startx</b> (<b>startx&nbsp;--&nbsp;:1</b>) at
the prompt so my skills in this are severely restricted. Therefore I
cannot advise on how one should go about doing this for GDM/KDM and
friends. Can GDM/KDM etc be started with something similar to 
<b>startx&nbsp;--&nbsp;:1</b>? I have no idea. Sorry.</p>


<h3>Final Remarks</h3>
<p> Here is a recap up to being able to <b>chroot</b>.</p>

<pre class="listing">
slackbox # mkdir -p /mnt/chroot
slackbox # cd /mnt/sources/slackware-11.0/slackware # Edit to suit.
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot/ a/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot ap/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot l/*.tgz
slackbox # installpkg -root /mnt/chroot n/*.tgz
slackbox # cp /etc/hosts /mnt/chroot/etc/hosts
slackbox # cp /etc/fstab /mnt/chroot/etc/fstab
# Now we chroot into our chroot environment
slackbox # mount -o bind /proc /mnt/chroot/proc
slackbox # mount -o bind /dev /mnt/chroot/dev
slackbox # chroot /mnt/chroot /bin/bash</pre>

<p> We did more but the above is enough to get us a <b>chroot</b>
environment. What extras you add from here is up to you. Above I showed
you how to add X&nbsp;+ GUI and how to set up <tt class="verb">/etc/inittab</tt> so
that our <b>chroot</b> environment has its own tty and I also showed you
how to setup a chrooted X environment so that it too has its own VC
separate from the main X VC. All these things and more are only limited
by your imagination so go and play and most of all enjoy yourself.</p>

<p> Finally, that script I promised you that will download the Slackware
packages and install them within the <b>chroot</b> directory.</p>

<pre class="quest">
#!/bin/bash
#
# This will download Slackware 11.0 packages and install them
# within a directory into which we will chroot.
# change this to wherever your own chroot directory is
CHROOTDIR=/mnt/chroot # Edit this to wherever you want your chroot.
ncftp <<**
open slackware.at
cd slackware-11.0/slackware
mget -r a/*
mget -r ap/*
mget -r l/*
mget n/*
# if you want X then uncomment these 3 lines
#mget -r x/*
#mget -r xap/*
#mget -r kde/*
exit
**
for FILE in *
do
installpkg -root $CHROOTDIR $FILE
done
</pre>

<p> Once the above script has been executed then your <b>chroot</b>
environment is ready. Follow this document from where we <b>chroot</b>
in.</p>
