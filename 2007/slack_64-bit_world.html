<h3>Day 1: <a href="http://www.bluewhite64.com">Bluewhite64</a></h3>

<p>
I type this as I go, bluewhite second download:
</p><p>
<a href="ftp://mirror.inode.at/bluewhite64/bluewhite64-11.0-dvd-iso/bluewhite64-11.0-install-dvd.iso">
<tt class="verb">ftp://mirror.inode.at/bluewhite64/bluewhite64-11.0-dvd-iso/bluewhite64-11.0-install-dvd.iso</tt></a>
</p><p>
also failed md5 checksum, but I give it a go anyway.
</p><p>
First boot failed to see the SATA disks, booted 'test26' and the
SATA drives are visible&mdash;this is a good start!
</p><p>
Installer startup looks just like slackware :o)
</p><p>
I'm installing to <tt class="verb">/dev/sdb2</tt> (8GB) and will boot via existing slack
install, so <b>lilo</b> will be <tt class="verb">boot /dev/sdb2</tt>, <tt class="verb">root /dev/sdb2</tt>.
</p><p>
Hit setup...  Bad news, it cannot see the CDROM, plan B?  Install from
hard drive.
</p><p>
Reboot to slackware and copy the DVD to <tt class="verb">/dev/sda6</tt>&mdash;cannot get slackware
to see the DVD, reboot to openSUSE and copy the DVD to a local partition.
</p><p>
OpenSUSE has working <b>hald</b> and <b>udev</b> ;)
Using the GUI to copy the DVD is
a no-brainer...  Except I forgot to mount <tt class="verb">/dev/sda6</tt> and I'm copying to
the freakin' mountpoint!  Luckily there's enough room for it :)
</p><p>
Okay, copy install source to <tt class="verb">/dev/sda6 -&gt; bw64</tt>, I'm doing this in an
<b>ssh</b> session, underneath the GUI.  For me, this is familiar territory.
</p><p>
Note: the 'slackware' directory is renamed to 'bluewhite64', so the
install path will be <tt class="verb">/dev/sda6 -&gt; /bw64/bluewhite64</tt>.
</p><p>
Here goes.  The example for HDD install is labelled <tt class="verb">/stuff/bluewhite64</tt>!
</p><p>
Hah!  Can see the install source :o))
</p><p>
Take the defaults from a 'menu' install&mdash;<b>linuxdoc</b> is corrupt, that's
a relief 'cos I don't use it ;)  Oops, <b>qt</b> is corrupt too :(  That's bad.
</p><p>
Now I hit the install kernel from HDD cannot find kernels. Bug, copy
<tt class="verb">/cdrom/bw64/kernels/test26.s/bzImage</tt> to <tt class="verb">/mnt/boot</tt>,
as well as its <tt class="verb">config</tt>.
</p><p>
Reboot to slackware to make a main <b>lilo</b> boot stanza for the new OS.
</p><p>
Kernel panic :(  cannot mount the root &mdash;&gt; Reboot to slackware&mdash;let's
fix this?  Kernel is <tt class="verb">/boot/bzImage</tt>, not <tt class="verb">vmlinuz</tt>!!
</p><p>
Well here I am, at a bw64 login: prompt  . . .  bluewhite64 is running,
it includes the expected slackware installer quirks and recovery methods.
</p><p>
Familiar territory for a slacker lucky enough to upgrade to modern
64bit hardware :)
</p><p>
Beware&mdash;I need to install the kernel modules from <tt class="verb">/testing</tt> to suit the
boot kernel&mdash;reboot...
</p><p>
Install missing <b>nfs-utils</b>, we have NFS!
</p><p>
Okay, add 'grant' user and edit <tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt> to include the kernel source
partition, compile a new 2.6.19.7 kernel to suit the hardware.
</p><p>
Reboot to new kernel, so now we have sound :)
</p><p>
KDE can't start due to the missing <b>libqt</b>...
</p><p>
Okay, we're on the familiar territory of finding and fixing the minor
glitches, I'm disappointed at the mirror holding an apparently faulty
.iso image&mdash;but the thing installed with only the usual minor hiccups.
</p><p>
Compiling 2.6.19.7 took 2 minutes for '<b>time make -j4</b>' :)
</p><p>
Now I need to grab the faulty packages and get KDE going.
</p>


<h3>Day 2:
<a href="http://www.slamd64.com/">Slamd64</a></h3>

<p>
Install was straightforward, as expected the installer couldn't find
the cdrom so I installed from hard drive.  Slamd64 comes with a 2.6.16.29
kernel which is a bit old.
</p><p>
Slamd64 had no problems installing <b>vmware</b> 5.5.3, it even works :)
</p><p>
NFS not behaving&mdash;unsure what the problem is as yet.  NFS worked as
expected with BW64.
</p><p>
Some screens in grey rather than the expected colours&mdash;me not sort out
why yet&mdash;minor niggle.
</p><p>
KDE runs okay.  Basically, Slamd64 works out of the 'box', apart from NFS.
</p>


<h3>Day 3: Updates</h3>
<p>
I've now got the local mirror of slamd64 install tree up-to-date with 
the source and will add at least one more installment after applying 
the patches since NFS gets a couple mentions in the Changelog.  Here's 
the update story.
</p>
<p>
Both BW64 and slamd64 have active <b>rsync</b> mirrors which allows me to
maintain a local install tree mirror&mdash;updating is then a simple
'<b>updatepkg /home/mirror/&lt;distro&gt;/patches/packages/*tgz</b>', except the
initial slamd64 will be via local hard drive as I <b>rsync</b> the install
tree over while booted into BW64.
</p><p>
Updating slamd64
</p><p>
Syncing up the local install tree with the mirror is an <b>rsync</b> one liner:
</p>
<pre class="listing">
rsync -avPH --delete --progress \
         rsync://mirror.vbfx.com/slamd64/slamd64-11.0/ \
         /home/mirror/slamd64-11.0
</pre>
<p>
Refresh the hard drive install source from the local server with:
</p>
<pre class="listing">
rsync -avPH --delete --progress /home/mirror/slamd64-11.0/ slamd64-11.0
</pre>
reboot to slamd64 and run the update:
<pre class="listing">
upgradepkg /home/grant/vmware/slamd64-11.0/patches/packages/*tgz
</pre><p>
(<tt class="verb">/home/grant/vmware</tt> is the temporary home of the install source).
</p><p>
Restart the NFS by issuing '<b>/etc/rc.d/rc.nfsd restart</b>' and
'<b>/etc/rc.d/rc.rpc restart</b>' and NFS mounts now work without locking up.
</p><p>
Now I modify <tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt> to mount the <tt class="verb">/home/common</tt>
NFS export on boot
and reboot to check there is no longer a bootup warning.  No, slamd64
still stalls on boot with an NFS error :(  For me, this is a showstopper.
I've applied the patches and slamd64 still stalls on boot, unusable.
</p><p>
Read through the slamd64 forum but see no mention of NFS problems,
cannot register to report the issue as the registration page looped on
submit then kicked me out after five tries :(  I had no such problem
registering on the bluewhite64 site.
</p><p>
Current status:
Slamd64 is a no go due to the NFS issue, while BW64 cannot run <b>vmware</b>
at the moment, Arny (the maintainer of BW64) is going to try it and report back.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Note: openSUSE 64bit is working fine, and <b>YaST</b> on a fast box is almost
bearable.  At the moment openSUSE works, and bluewhite64 is a promising
slackware port.  Slamd64 is depressing since it has the showstopper no
NFS plus is dreary grey on screens (<b>vim</b> and <b>make menuconfig</b>) that are
usually coloured.
</p>


<h3>Day 4: Slamd64-current</h3>
<p>
Using the slamd64 DVD install tree as a base, I <b>rsync</b>'d it to get a
slamd64-current install tree.  Then <b>rsync</b> across to new box preparing
for a hard drive install.
</p><p>
Install from boot to slamd64 DVD to reboot into the new system took 14
minutes!  This was an install from hard drive.  Slamd64-current uses the
2.6.18 kernel and I'm pleased to report mounted the localnet system-wide
NFS export without a hitch.
</p><p>
I'm also pleased to report that the colour is back to 'normal', compared
with the earlier slamd64 install.  Let me explain, the first file I copy
to a new install is a <tt class="verb">.vimrc</tt> for the root account, then when I edit the
<tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt> I expect a known colour scheme.  The first file I create is
<tt class="verb">.ssh/authorized_keys</tt> to allow password-less login from localnet machines.
</p><p>
Then I add the NFS mounts to the <tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt> file and create a user account.
</p><p>


<h3>Day 5: The Two plus <a href="http://www.sflack.com/">Sflack</a></h3>
<p>
State of play:
</p><p>
Bluewhite64-11.0, bluewhite64-current: waiting for Arny to try installing
<b>vmware</b> and fix the library issue.
</p><p>
Slamd64-11.0: no NFS&mdash;fixed in <tt class="verb">-current</tt>.
Slamd64-current works on the few tests I've used: NFS, sound in KDE, install
<b>vmware</b> okay.
</p><p>
Sflack-11.0 library issue prevents install of <b>vmware</b>, has sound in KDE, for
some reason is about 12% slower in the kernel compile benchmark.
</p><p>
Sflack-current not sufficiently different (only two packages) to bother
installing for test.
</p><p>
Conclusions?  At this early stage I'm likely to drop Sflack and track
BW64-current as well as slamd64-current.
</p><p>
I'm also running openSUSE-10.2 and WinXP on the new box.  At present the
openSUSE <b>grub</b> boot loader owns the MBR and can reach any of the eight
installed OS.  This is too many OS to support in the one box but hey, this
is for fun, right?
</p><p>
No confirmation email for joining slamd64 forum yet :(
I need to wait for the world to catch up.
</p>   


<h3>Day 6: More on Vmware</h3>
<p>
I'm disliking sflack 'cos it's hard to pronounce, besides it
infringes on Patrick's &quot;don't use slackware or anything sounding
like slack&quot; (paraphrased) request for slackware clones.  Sflack
is the least developed of the three, going by the <tt class="verb">-current</tt> offering.
</p><p>
I installed nVidia 64bit video driver to slamd64-current without
a problem.  Also successfully installed 64-bit <b>vmware</b> 6.0beta to
BW64 but it failed to load a guest OS, again due to the missing
library&mdash;I assume this 'cos if I symlink <tt class="verb">ld-linux.so.2</tt> in I get
a 'corrupted shared...' error, same as I had with <b>vmware</b> 5.5.3.
</p><p>
The 64bit <b>vmware</b> 6.0beta works in slamd64-current.  As far as a
64-bit slackware clone goes, slamd64-current is the one that fails
to fail ;)
</p>

<h3>Day 7: Why 64?</h3>
<p>
Another comparison: why go 64-bit?  Consider that the best kernel compile
time for 64bit mode was just under two minutes, and with slackware the
same test returns 2m13 for a '<b>make clean; time make -j4</b>'.  Running 64-bit
mode would appear to be 10% faster than running 32bit mode on the same
hardware.  For comparison, on a 2.4GHz P4 HT box the result is 6m25.
</p><p>
The <b>vmware</b> 6.0beta comes in 32 or 64-bit versions for linux.  Likewise
the nVidia display driver.
</p><p>
Another comparison between 32 and 64-bit modes, both with latest nVidia
drivers and kernel 2.6.20.3: <b>glxgears</b> on slackware yields 1638fps, on
slamd64-current 1760fps which is a 7.5% improvement.
</p>

<h3>Day 8: YaST (abbr.)</h3>
<p>
Bluewhite64 ask EUR39 (USD51) for a DVD.
Slamd64 asks for an 'appropriate' donation.
Sflack don't ask for anything.
</p><p>
All offer a free download.
</p><p>
Last night I sucked slamd64-current and sflack out of the logical
partitions and into the primaries.  Overwriting the BW64 and Slamd64
installations.  Why?  So I can use <b>lilo</b> as boot loader&mdash;even the
latest version of <b>lilo</b> cannot see the second drive logical partitions.
</p><p>
Done this because <b>YaST</b> -&gt; system -&gt; boot loader locked up again, the
thing was respawning a file parser looping forever, 
I hate <b>YaST</b>&mdash;Yet another Stupid Thing ;)
</p>

<h3>Day 9</h3>
<p>
Sflack also seems slow.  It is going from my list, leaving slamd64-current
in top place with BW64-current in second.  I'm
yet to hear from Fred (the maintainer of Slamd64).  Installation of 64-bit 
nVidia graphics driver to
BW64 failed due to library issues :(  This promotes slamd64-current to
being the only useful 64bit variant of slackware, no?  The nVidia install
also fails for sflack, very early 'file not found' (unspecified).
</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
Other users do not have the same problems I see with bluewhite64, I can only 
assume it is the hardware being newer.  
I installed bluewhite64 again from clean source which failed to resolve 
the issues.  For me, slamd64-current does the expected.  
</p><p>
One needs to take great care when installing from a corrupt DVD image, in 
retrospect, I would check the install tree first and delete any faulty files, 
then rsync the replacement files in <em>before</em> installing.  
Much confusion in the above would then be avoided.
