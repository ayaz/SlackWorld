 <h2>Persona Grata: Robby Workman.
     A teacher of science and a politically-minded Linux geek</h2>

 <p>
  Published: April 14, 2007
 </p>


  <p><em>The Slack World:
   Robby, prior to asking the questions, we studied
   <a href="http://rlworkman.net">your site</a>, and the first question is:
   from teaching, through emergency management agency and
   being a reserve deputy, how did you get interested in
   computers and become a Linux geek?</em></p>

<p><b>Robby Workman:</b>
I'm actually a &quot;late bloomer&quot; in the computer world.  I'll try to keep it 
relatively short, as I'm sure very few people are interested in the mundane
details...   I had an old 350 MHz AMD whitebox that someone gave me back in
my old hometown, and after I moved to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama">Tuscaloosa</a>,
I decided to get a new one.
Rather than buy one from Dell or Gateway or whatever, I decided to try and
learn something new, so I did a bit of research and ordered a bunch of parts
from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">NewEgg</a> and built it myself.
For what it's worth, it still serves as my
primary workhorse box&mdash;2.6&nbsp;GHz P4 with HT, 1.5&nbsp;GB RAM,
and a couple of large
SATA drives.  Anyway, I had always used Outlook Express as a mail client, and
I hated it, so I was looking for something new.  I stumbled upon Mozilla
Thunderbird (it was still in development&mdash;0.4 at the time), so I gave it a
try, and both my wife and I really liked it, even at that early stage of 
development.  As I got more familiar with it, I started helping out with
user support in the Thunderbird forums, and I saw lots of talk about this
&quot;linux&quot; operating system.  Curiosity got the best of me... :)</p>

<p><em>
2. When did you stick in Slack?  How did this happen?</em></p>


<p> My initial foray into Linux was with Mandrake and Fedora.  I had done
some reading about Linux in general, and it supposedly had this
reputation for being a &quot;geek&quot; thing.  Both Mandrake and Fedora
worked out of the box pretty well, and I messed around with them for a
few days, but they seemed too &quot;Windows-like.&quot; That's not to say
that there's anything wrong with  being like Windows
necessarily&mdash;it's just not what I wanted&mdash;I was more interested
in something to challenge me. I liked the name
&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Linux">CollegeLinux</a>&quot;
(which was at that time based on Slackware 9.1), so I installed it and
actually kept it for a few weeks.  I liked the way everything was laid out
on it (as it turns out, they deviated from default Slackware very little),
and I had read that it was derived from Slackware, so I did some research
on Slackware.  Slackware was supposedly the most Unix-like distribution
of Linux available, and I had by this point read quite a bit about UNIX
in general, so it sounded good to me.  This was around August or September
of 2004&mdash;a couple or three months after that first download of a linux
iso.</p>

<p><em>3. Do you try other distros these days?</em></p>

<p>
No, not very much.  I've dabbled in OpenBSD a bit, and I'm a big fan of their
stance on lots of issues.  I think the open-source community as a whole has
probably been a bit too quick to jump on the &quot;pragmatic&quot; bandwagon and accept
&quot;solutions&quot; that don't have long-term viability, which is not to say that I
think proprietary software is evil (or that those who use it are evil), but
I would like to see better open-source drivers especially for the popular
graphics cards, and it seems that the widespread community acceptance of the
proprietary solutions has hampered that effort&mdash;there's no overwhelming user
pressure for those vendors to release the necessary hardware specifications 
for developing open drivers.</p>

<p>
Anyway, back to the question: if I ever decide to branch out from the &quot;hobby&quot;
aspect of computing and try to make a career out of it, then there's no
doubt that I'll need to be familiar with some of the other distributions; 
however, for the time being, I'm happy with Slackware, so I just don't see
the need to look at others most of the time.  With that said, I've certainly
looked at the sources of some other distros to see how they handled various
things, and I'm definitely of the opinion that we can all learn things from
each other.</p>

<p><em>
4. What window manager do you use (or are you a CLI guy)?</em></p>


<p>
I'm rather partial to <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a>.
That's not to say that it's better or worse than
kde, gnome, or some other window manager/desktop environment, but it suits the
way I work really well.  I've got enough hardware horsepower to run kde or 
whatever, but I don't really use any of the kde applications (okay, maybe k3b),
so I prefer to use that horsepower to do something besides drive my desktop
environment.</p>

<p>
With that said, I'm not really reliant on X&mdash;I find that
'<b>links&nbsp;-g</b>' is more
than adequate for most of the browsing I do, and I use both pine and mutt
regularly on remote boxes.  For general system administration, I strongly
prefer a plain bash/ksh interface. :)</p>

<p><em>
5. <b>Ayaz:</b> I use Slackware.  I love Slackware.  But when
asked why, I flounder  haplessly, with litte more to say than
&quot;because it is simple and puts me in  control of the system.&quot; 
Why do <b>you</b> love Slackware (I am assuming you do)?</em></p>

<p>
What more is there <b>to</b> say?  ;-)   Seriously, the second part <b>is</b>
the reason I love Slackware&mdash;<b>I</b> am in control of my system.  If I
want to do something that's possibly braindead, then I am allowed to
do it (and of course, <b>I</b> get to pick up the pieces if it actually
 <b>was</b> braindead).  This is an oft-repeated saying that borders on
&quot;cliche,&quot; but it's true: when you learn Slackware, you learn Linux.
In some other distributions, you learn distribution-specific ways of
doing things (such as configuring the network, configuring sound,
etcetera),whereas in Slackware, you learn the generic (portable) ways
of doing those things.  The distribution-specific ways might usually
work just fine, but you can be guaranteed that the generic ways will
work.</p>

<p>
I'm going to sound like I'm picking on Debian before this
is over, but I promise I'm not&mdash;it just so happens that I've actually
used a Debian box a little bit, and I know a few people who admin one,
so I'm a bit more familiar with it than with some others.  One thing
that bothers me about Debian is that it basically manages your system
for you&mdash;for example, if you make changes to syslog.conf and/or
logrotate.conf, they will be overwritten when you update/upgrade those
packages, so you have to go back and make the changes all over again.
It seems to me that Debian is <b>very</b> easy to maintain so long as you
leave the default configuration&mdash;for some people, that's acceptable,
but for me, it's not.  Another issue with the automated dependency
resolution is when packages list dependencies that are only necessary
because the distribution insists on doing things different than the
application's upstream maintainers do&mdash;for example, the Debian
package for squid has (had?) a dependency on the logrotate package,
even though squid by default rotates its own logs; basically, the
Debian folks configured squid to use logrotate instead.  In this
particular case, that might not be a bad thing&mdash;it depends on what
most users want, I suppose; however, this highlights another of
Slackware's strong points&mdash;with rare exception, Slackware doesn't
patch upstream sources [<a href="#remark">1</a>]; the package you install is exactly what
you would get if you compiled it yourself using the instructions from
the upstream developers.  That might not sound important, but it is
a major issue if/when bugs are encountered&mdash;I've seen countless
examples of finger-pointing: a user reports the bug to the upstream
developers, who then blame the distribution's patches, so the user
reports it to the distribution, who refer him to upstream, and so on.</p>

<p id="remark">
[1] In those cases where upstream sources are patched, it is generally
    to address security issues or to make them compile on whatever
    toolchain is in use in that Slackware version.</p>

<p><em>
6.  It may be an old horse that has been beaten countless times with sticks, 
but it sprouts up just as often when comparing and contrasting Slackware with 
other Linux distributions (and, perhaps, non-Linux distributions as well), 
plus I often find myself short of convincing words when talking about it:  
Why do you think the lack of dependency checking in Slackware's package
management system make it so simple and great?</em></p>

<p>
It's not hard to find examples of automatic dependency resolution
causing problems, whether it's the native implementations in some
other linux distributions or in the various third-party attempts
for Slackware.  We've all heard about &quot;rpm hell&quot; on the various
RPM-based distributions, and
<a href="http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/xfce/2007-March/020888.html">here</a>'s
one from Debian.</p>

<p>
Granted, that's a packaging problem for sure, but the point is that
such errors simply aren't possible with Slackware's native tools for
package management.  That's not to say that there aren't other issues
that can cause problems with Slackware's package tools - for example,
there's no way to ensure that a package isn't overwriting files that
are contained in some other package, and I've been nailed by that
before (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/">GNU pth</a>,
if built incorrectly, overwrites one of the headers
in the glibc package, and then problems occur building some things
later&mdash;I pulled some hair before I finally figured that one out).
That weakness though, is also a strength, because unlike the automated
things that try to be &quot;smart&quot; about it, it was easily remedied by
reinstalling the glibc package.  One could argue that it wouldn't have
happened to begin with if Slackware's package tools were &quot;smart&quot; about
it, but then, overwriting files in other packages is usually harmless,
so the headache associated with having packages refusing to install
because some icon or something is present in two packages (and thus
being forces to pass some flag to override it) just isn't worth it
(IMHO).</p>

<p id="devel"><em>
7. You've been mentioned in Slackware's ChangeLog quite a few times. Based on 
   your experiences, <b>what is the best way for someone to help out with the
   Slackware development process?</b></em></p>


<p>
Well, I'm not sure I have any more insight into the process than anybody else,
but I'll throw this out...  
First of all, keep in mind that Slackware -current is the <b>development</b> version
of Slackware&mdash;it is not intended for production use, as it's basically just a
daily snapshot along the road to a new stable release.  That being said, if
you are interested in helping Slackware development, using -current is the way
to go.  I won't go so far as to say that this is <b>the</b> way to do it, but...
If I find a &quot;bug&quot; in Slackware, I first check the various IRC channels, the
<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/forumdisplay.php?f=14">Slackware forum on LinuxQuestions.org</a>,
the Slackware related mailing lists, the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.linux.slackware/">alt.os.linux.slackware newsgroup</a>,
and google in general to see if someone else has run across it and/or
fixed it, or at the very least, to see if anyone else can reproduce
it&mdash;if it's just me having the problem, the the problem is likely
ME.  :)  Regardless of how the above works out, I try to find a solution
before I mail Pat.  I'm not saying that I <b>always</b> have a solution or
patch included in my mails to him, but I try&mdash;here's my
rationale:</p>

<blockquote>
  If other people have also found the bug, it's safe to assume that Pat's inbox
  has already been flooded with reports that lack solutions&mdash;there's no need
  to add one more.  If other people have *not* found the bug, then there's
  no need to get in a rush, as there's time to look for a solution before I 
  send a mail to him.</blockquote>



<p><em>
8. <b>Mikhail:</b> Robby, as far as I know, you are one of
the founders of the
<a href="http://SlackBuilds.org">SlackBuilds.org</a>
project, which I think is one of the most useful
Slackware-related projects in the Net.
How did you come to the idea of the project and
what are its basic principles?</em></p>

<p>
First of all, what we've done with this project isn't original at all&mdash;a guy
named George&nbsp;Georgeakis had a site called &quot;<a href="http://slackpack.tripleg.net.au/">SlackBuild Central</a>&quot; for a while
(and he's still got it online for historical reference), but it had long been
out of date and unsupported due to his work demands.  There were quite a few
different people hosting build scripts for various applications, but there
was no central place to look and you didn't know what you were getting when
you pulled a script from some random corner of the web&mdash;as with everything
else, the quality was sometimes very good and sometimes very bad.  There had
often been rumblings in the Slackware channel on freenode's IRC network of 
trying to start a central repository, but as is often the case, lots of people
talk and nobody <b>does</b> anything.  I don't remember the exact conversation, but
to make a long story short, Erik&nbsp;Hanson (the <a href="http://www.gware.org/">GWare</a> maintainer) and I were 
discussing it and one of us said &quot;let's do it.&quot;  We brought a few others on 
board and started working behind the scenes on putting together a small group
of scripts for initial offering.  We went live in July 2006, and the project
has been steadily growing since then.  It's still somewhat overwhelming to see
just how successful it's become, and I think a lot of that success is due to
our philosophy; we try to be true to the &quot;Slackware Way&quot;&mdash;that is, to keep 
things as simple as possible without unnecessary complexity.</p>

<p>
One of our main ideas at SlackBuilds.org is the KISS principle. We
are generally not very fond of trying to emulate the features of a
full-blown ports system.  That's not to say that a ports-style system
is bad, but it's just not something we want to do.  Some of those
concerns are related to straying from the &quot;Slackware Way,&quot; and some
are purely time issues.  With a small team of volunteers, most of
whom have roles in other major projects, we have to be very careful
of what we obligate ourselves to do...  Did that make any sense at
all??  ;-)</p>


<p> While I'm talking about SlackBuilds.org, I'd like to issue a public
&quot;THANKS&quot;  to everyone in the Slackware community that has
contributed scripts to us, used/tested any of our stuff, and/or
recommended us to other users.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that our
success would not have been possible without the community support that
we've gotten.  As of right now, we have scripts  from fifty-one different
authors in the repository.</p>

<p><em>Thank you, Robby!  Have the best of luck in all your activities!</em></p>
