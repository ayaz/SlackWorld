<h2>Slackware 12.0: A review</h2>
<p>
<b>Author:</b>  <a href="../hearts.html#michielvwessem">Michiel van Wessem</a></p>

</p>
<p>
Well, it has been that time again and Patrick has released a new version
of our most favourite Operating System, and I am sure that everyone who
has been awake the last couple of days has noticed this. So what has
changed between versions 11.0 and the newest flagship 12.0? 
</p>
<p>
A lot, actually. Let's have a look on both the outside and inside to see
what has changed.
</p>
<p>
Undoubtedly, the major changes are clear: a new toolchain (containing a
new glibc and a  new gcc), a modular Xorg, new XFCE  (4.4.1) and the
latest KDE-3.5.7, not to forget DBUS and HAL automounting for desktop
users, and above all the first Slackware to be completely 2.6. There
are many other changes as well, a lot of them are already highlighted by
Patrick himself in his <a href="http://slackware.com/announce/12.0.php">official announcement</a>,
and by <a href="../hearts.html#robbyworkman">Robby Workman</a> in his <tt class="verb">CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT</tt>. 
</p>
<p>
Let's have a little bit of an overview of what is new and changed.
</p>
<h3>The Kernel</h3>
<p>
Let's start at the heart of any Linux distro, the kernel. With 12.0
Slackware has moved out of the 2.4 range and gone to be a solemnly a 2.6
kernel affair only. Slackware now comes with 4 separate kernels. Standard
is the 2.6.21.5 kernel, which was also the latest (at time of writing,
.6 just came out before I could finish this article) stable kernel being
offered at kernel.org. 
</p>
<p>
The standard kernel used during the install is the huge-smp kernel. There
are two <tt class="verb">huge-*</tt> and two <tt class="verb">generic-*</tt> kernels in Slackware.
The <tt class="verb">huge-*</tt> kernels
have almost every driver in the kernel built in, which makes them ideal for
use during the installation. The <tt class="verb">generic-*</tt> kernels offer the same amount
of hardware support, however the biggest difference is that unlike the
-huge kernel, in the -generic mostly everything is compiled as a
module. Using the generic kernel will mean you need to build an initrd.
Luckily with help of the <tt class="verb">README.initrd</tt>, <b>mkinitrd(8)</b> and <tt class="verb">mkinitrd --help</tt>
it's not all that hard to figure out.
</p>
<p>
There maybe however some software (such as the NVIDIA drivers) that
requires your system to be configured as completely non-smp. For that
purpose Patrick has included a linux-2.6.21.5-nosmp-sdk. This will patch
several kernel-headers as well as the standard kernel config.
</p>
<h3>Other Changes</h3>
<p>
One of the bigger (and under the hood) changes of Slackware is the new
toolchain. This includes a new glibc (upgraded to version 2.5), new
binutils and a new gcc compiler (upgraded to gcc4.1.2). Another big
change in Slackware is the addition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_%28software%29">HAL</a> (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBUS">DBUS</a>. This makes automounting of CDs, digital cameras and USB devices
a breeze. Insert, click about a bit, and voila: instant access to your
information.
</p>
<p>
The two other big changes are of course that both modular Xorg (Xorg 7.2
is included as the standard Xserver) and KDE-3.5.7 are compiled to be
both installed into <tt class="verb">/usr</tt> to fit better in line with the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Home">freedesktop.org</a>
recommendations for unifying the various Linux desktops. The added bonus
is that the more centralised use of <tt class="verb">/usr</tt> will actually make building
third-party packages a lot easier to deal with in the future.
</p>
<p>
As for the network services, things have been improved as well. The old
tcpip package has now been split into a number of smaller packages, each
containing their own specific utilities. From a maintenance
point-of-view, this certainly makes sense. It will be a lot easier for
Patrick and the Crew to maintain the different utilities instead of
reminding themselves how to build the bigger tcpip packages.
</p>
<p>
Another one of the bigger changes in Slackware 12.0 is the dropped
support for the old and trusty apache-1.3.x webserver, which is being replaced
by httpd. When this was first announced in the <tt class="verb">ChangeLog.txt</tt>, it caused a
bit of confusion. Basically, httpd is what is generally called apache2,
just using the official name the Apache Project has given their
webserver.
</p>
<p>
Other new things include the support for Bluetooth in the shape of the
bluez utility set. Also automatic support for Network Time Protocol has
been added. New in this version is support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP">SNMP</a>.
This is especially
useful for when being used in a server environment or for example with an
UPS.  It's perhaps a tiny improvement but all in all it gives Slackware
that extra shiny glossy finished feel.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps one of the more surprising steps was the inclusion of the
traditional SystemV init directories. Before now, these needed to be
added by the user if (or when) they were needed (for example: when
installing WMWare or Xen on Slackware). I think this has always caused
confusion for a lot of people, but in short it comes down to this:
Slackware is a SystemV system that uses BSD Style Scripts (Style being
the operative word here). The clue as to why, is twofold. The first is
that in a SystemV init system, the <tt class="verb">/etc/inittab</tt> is being used (as does
Slackware). Secondly, if you have a look through the startup scripts,
<tt class="verb">rc.sysvinit</tt> is called for every runlevel change, startup or stopping of
the machine. Still Slackware's way of dealing with its startup script is
(at least in my opinion) much cleaner than the more traditional
SystemV init system and better than BSD handles it (but then again, that
is probably not a great surprise).
</p>
<p>
In version 12.0, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key">&quot;magic SysRQ key&quot;</a>
in the kernel is enabled by
default. The SysRQ key is a way to communicate with the kernel on a very
low level without interfering with or by anything else. Basically it
allows for &quot;magical&quot; key combos you can hit which the kernel will respond
to regardless of whatever else it is doing, unless it is completely
locked up. One Example is:
</p>
	<blockquote>
	&quot;Raising Skinny Elephants Is Utterly Boring&quot;
	</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
The above statement stands for the keys to be pressed in order to reboot
a completely locked machine. The meaning is in the first letters of each
word: (R)aw keyboard mode (S)ync the disk t(E)rminate the processes
k(I)ll all processes remo(U)nt all file systems read only and finally
re(B)oot the system.
</p>
<p>
One of the additions which will benefit a lot of people who use KDE and
KMail is the integration of full encryption in KMail. Before 12.0 it was
possible to actually sign and encrypt mails and understand who signed
emails. However decrypting emails was not possible (at least not on the
fly). However, now with the added libraries and tooling, KMail has no
longer any problem dealing with encrypted emails.
</p>
<p>
One thing I almost forgot to touch upon more deeply (although I mentioned
it very briefly before) is the inclusion of DBus and HAL from
freedesktop.org. Dbus offers a simple way for applications to communicate
with each other. HAL, short for Hardware Abstraction Layer, offers a way
for desktop applications from, for example, KDE and XFCE to readily
access the hardware information so that they can locate and use such
hardware regardless of bus or device type. This will make it much
easier for users to have direct and quick access to their hardware
including features such as automounting. With HAL enabled, you no longer
need to have lines for your cd/dvd or usb device in your <tt class="verb">/etc/fstab</tt>. HAL
will detect the device and automatically make it available.
</p>
<p>
The biggest caveat with HAL is that you <i>have</i> to add your users to the
<tt class="verb">plugdev</tt> group.
<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=566862">This posting</a>
by Robby Workman on Linuxquestions.org explains exactly why and what the issue is.
</p>
<h3>The Installation</h3>
<p>
The installer itself hasn't changed much. Other than that the installer
is still the same in looks as we've always seen in Slackware. It works
well and it's trusted. I have played in the past with other installers
and none are as clean, quick and easy to understand as the Slackware
installer. (Even my girlfriend can install Slackware ;) )
</p>
<p>
One of the things that has been removed from Slackware is the old floppy
disk install. Even though this has been part of Slackware since the
beginning of time (or rather the beginning of Slackware), it has now been
dropped in favour of either a USB or a PXE (think netbooting) install. 
In that same fashion, the &quot;create bootdisk&quot; has been replaced by a
USB-variant. 
</p>
<p>
The installer has now support for both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29">LVM</a>
as well as encrypted
partitions (using <b>cryptsetup</b> aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>).
Both are well documented by
<tt class="verb">README_CRYPT.TXT</tt> and <tt class="verb">README_LVM.TXT</tt>
by the hand of <a href="../hearts.html#alien">Eric Hameleers</a> (aka
AlienBOB). Having tried the cryptsetup on my laptop, it worked flawlessly
(apart from a slight PEBKAC). Please note that there is a small addition 
to the way that the setup uses encrypted partitions and lilo. These extra
notes have been published on 
<a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=Slackware:setup">alien's wiki</a>.
</p>

<h3>Upgrading from a previous installation</h3>
<p>
Upgrading is as per usual with Slackware still a viable option. However due to 
the many changes in Slackware, such as the path changes in Xorg, KDE and 
packages that have have been split into multiple packages (such as sysvinit* 
and tcpip), anyone wanting to upgrade their machine from 11.0 to 12.0 in a 
safe manner, should ((or rather almost <i>must</i>) carefully read and follow the 
<tt class="verb">CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT</tt>. Robby Workman has put in a lot of work detailing and 
documenting every step that needs to be done for a seamless upgrade. Please 
Do not forget to run <b>lilo</b> afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Also note that non-empty directories will not be removed by the pkgtools
(<b>removepkg(8)</b> / <b>upgradepkg(8)</b>). So after the installation, you may have
some old directories lying around (<tt class="verb">/etc/hotplug</tt> and <tt class="verb">/etc/apache</tt> come to
mind). So have a good look through your <tt class="verb">/etc/</tt> directory when you are done
upgrading. (I suggest making sure you have a backup of <tt class="verb">/etc/</tt> before you
remove anything. But we all make regular backups, right?)
</p>
<p>
One of the things to easily forget is to either run <b>lilo</b> afterwards, or
to merge all the new files. Especially the new files <i>must</i> be merged
before hand, otherwise a lot of strange things might happen or just plain
not work. The best way I have found to do it is to just keep running
<tt class="verb">find&nbsp;/etc/&nbsp;-name&nbsp;&quot;*.new&quot;</tt> until that search runs out of any results
that it can find. Having done a couple of upgrades (somewhere around four
to six times), as long as you strictly follow the <tt class="verb">CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT</tt>
you really can't go wrong.
</p>
<p>
One note of warning: If for some reason you are relying on external tools
such as slapt-get and swaret, you <i>will</i> run into problems. Those tools
have no idea of how to do upgrades and basically will upgrade things in
an alphabetic order. This means that things like <b>bash</b> get upgraded before
the glib-solibs package. As bash in Slackware-12.0 is linked against
this, you will see enormous problems. (Basically all will stop working).
Take my advice, don't use these tools. No seriously, just don't. However
if you are have managed to muck up your install in this way, not all is
lost yet. Robby Workman has written a <a href="http://rlworkman.net/howtos/glibc-recovery">document</a> on how to repair/rescue
your system. On that note,
if you feel the need to have a bit of the upgrade process done
automagickly, I can recommend <b>slackpkg</b>, available in the <tt class="verb">/extra</tt> directory.
Slackpkg is written by PiterPunk
and supports upgrading from 11.0 to 12.0 as long as you follow the
man page.
</p>

<h3>How to get Slackware</h3>
<p>
There are a couple of ways to get your hands on Slackware. The best way
of course is to buy the disk from the <a href="http://store.slackware.com/">Slackware store</a>.
That way you do
something good, support the project financially and get a fancy set of
CDs (or the DVD) to put on your bookshelf. 
</p>
<p>
You can also of course download Slackware from the mirrors. You can find
a list of mirrors either <a href="http://slackware.com/getslack/">here</a> or 
<a href="http://alphageek.dyndns.org/linux/slackware-mirrors.shtml">there</a>. However
instead of downloading the ISOs straight from a mirror, the preferred way
is to use the torrents. Slackware.com puts their releases out there as
torrents for the 6 CDs and the DVD. So the more people use the torrents
the more and better the speed will be.
</p>
<p>
One other way will be to use <b>rsync(8)</b> and sync the full mirrors onto your
local hard drive (disk2disk install or upgrades are lightning fast). But
once you have the mirror synced completely, you could use 
<a href="http://alphageek.dyndns.org/linux/sligdo/">sligdo</a>] to create your own ISOs
rather quickly (these will be mirrors that are a 100% compatible with the
ISOs offered by the torrents).
</p>
<p>
If you just want the binaries you just need the first couple of CDs.
Disc&nbsp;1 contains
<tt class="verb">a/</tt>, <tt class="verb">ap/</tt>, <tt class="verb">d/</tt>, <tt class="verb">e/</tt>, <tt class="verb">f/</tt>,
<tt class="verb">k/</tt>, <tt class="verb">l/</tt>, <tt class="verb">n/</tt>, <tt class="verb">tcl/</tt>, <tt class="verb">y/</tt> series. All you
need to get a basic system ready to run. The only things you will be
missing out on is anything related to the X-series. But if you want to go
for a lean server install this is all you need. For those who want a bit
more, they want to download Disc&nbsp;2 which contains the
<tt class="verb">kde/</tt>, <tt class="verb">t/</tt>, <tt class="verb">x/</tt>, <tt class="verb">xap/</tt>,
and most of <tt class="verb">/extra</tt>, as well as the <tt class="verb">/usb-and-pxe-installers</tt>. Disc&nbsp;3
contains kdei/ which you really only need if you want some extra language
support, and even then, it may be a lot quicker just to download the
<tt class="verb">kde-i18n-*</tt> and the <tt class="verb">koffice-l10n-*</tt> for your own language. Of course the
choice is yours. CDs 4-6 are the source CDs and contain all the sources
that were used to create Slackware. If you download the DVD you get of
course everything, including a copy of <a href="http://www.slackbook.org/">The Revised Slackware Book</a> aka
&quot;The Good Book&quot; or
&quot;Slackware Linux Essentials&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Repositories</h3>
<p>
If you want extra packages for Slackware, or you are just missing that
special package, there are a few places on the Internet that I recommend.
Of course the first one will be <a href="http://slackbuilds.org/">SlackBuilds.org</a>
(yes, I am probably biased).  The team over at SlackBuilds.org have
worked hard during the last month to get their whole archive converted
and tested to confirm that they work on 12.0 before Slackware was
released.
</p>
<p>
However if SlackBuilds.org don't have the scripts for that package that
you need, have either a look at  
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/">AlienBOB's repository</a>
or have a look at <a href="http://rlworkman.net/pkgs/">Robby Workman's one</a>. Alternatively you could compile
it from source using one of the many tools that Slackware gives you
(<b>makepkg(8)</b>, or <b>slacktrack(8)</b>). Of course if you feel really up for it,
create a SlackBuild script (see a 
<a href="http://slackbuilds.org/guidelines/">HOWTO</a>)
and submit it. The more applications
we have in our repository the better.
</p>
<p>
If you really have a desperate need to use precompiled packages, the only
site I can recommend is <a href="http://www.slacky.eu">slacky.eu</a> (formerly known
as slacky.it). They also provide the Slackbuild script and the source
with each package, so you can still compile your own.
</p>

<h3>Community and Support</h3>
<p>
Slackware has one of the best communities I have come across. As long as
you are willing to put in a little bit of work, people are generally
willing to help you out. Sure we might expect from you that you read the
manpages after we have pointed them out, that you know what you generally
are doing, that you actually can do some rudimentary googling. I always
found <a href="http://mikeash.com/getting_answers.html">this page</a> a good link
on helping and getting help for your problems.
</p>
<p>
There are two good irc channels available for your support, ##Slackware
on irc.freenode.net and #Slackware on irc.oftc.net. Also, there is the
<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/forumdisplay.php?f=14">Slackware forum over at linuxquestions.org</a>.
Of course once you have Slackware up and running it certainly wouldn't hurt
to at least sign up for the Slackware <a href="http://www.slackware.com/lists/">mailing list</a>, so you'll be kept up
to the date when there is a vulnerability out and Patrick has provided a
patch or an update for the package.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
If you want to run Slackware as a server, it is more than up for the
task, not only do you get a stable platform, you also get loads of
services by default: bind, httpd (apache2), MySQL, PHP (so you are
already setup for a LAMP machine if you wished so),
sendmail/getmail/procmail/IMAP, vsftp and proftd (FTP servers), samba, a
DHCP Daemon, an NTP daemon and secure shell access. So pretty much
whatever you want. There are some services Slackware doesn't yet provide
(I am thinking of things like single sign-on services and things that may
depend on PAM.) 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if you want Slackware as a desktop it is more than up
to the task with this latest version. A very good looking XFCE and of
course the latest version of the KDE Desktop Environment. And for the
applications? I could name every application that I think is worth
mentioning, but it will be come an endless list of what is good and what
is better. Besides if you have read the <tt class="verb">CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT</tt> and the
<tt class="verb">RELEASE_NOTES</tt> and Patrick's <a href="http://slackware.com/announce/12.0.php">official announcement</a>
you will have noticed most of
the new stuff already. Suffices to say that Slackware delivers at least a
very complete set of applications to do your daily work. I can easily do
a lot of work without having anything extra installed.
</p>
<p>
I can't conclude any different than simply stating the fact that with
Slackware 12.0, Patrick&nbsp;Volkerding has delivered an outstanding piece of work, which
just simply and clearly outshines any of the previous versions of
Slackware. I have debated doing a scoreboard for the various parts in
Slackware, but I realised at the end of it it was going to be useless as
I would rate everything high regardless. The biggest problem I faced when
writing this article is that I found myself starting to sound like a
broken record. This is better, This is good, This has improved... 
</p>
<p>
and to be honest on that bombshell...
</p>
<p>
Yes, Slackware 12.0 is simply THAT good!&nbsp;[DOT]
