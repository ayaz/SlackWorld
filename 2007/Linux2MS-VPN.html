 <h2>A quickie on how to set up a Linux to MS VPN</h2>

 <p>  
   There are many reasons why you, as a Linux user, would want or need to
   connect your Linux workstation to an MS VPN server. In this short
   document I will show you how simple this process is.
 </p><p>
   What we need to make this work is PPPD and its associated kernel modules
   and PPTP from <a href="http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/">http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/</a>.
   Download, extract,
   build and install <b>pptp</b>. The <b>pptp</b> archive does not have a
   <tt class="verb">configure</tt> in it.
   Instead we can simply <b>make</b> and <b>sudo make install</b>
   (or perhaps <b>checkinstall</b>
   if you use that program). More advanced users may want to strip the <b>pptp</b>
   binary by doing &quot;<b>strip --strip-unneeded pptp</b>&quot; and
   &quot;<b>gzip pptp.8</b>&quot; before
   installing <b>pptp</b>. It is not difficult to create ones own 
   slackpak for <b>pptp</b>
   but that is beyond the scope of this mini how to. The steps outlined
   above are enough to get a working <b>pptp</b>. 
 </p><p>
   However, if you are like me and roll your own kernels then you may need
   to redo it and select the relevant modules. To give you a hand in
   selecting the options we must have see below. Load up your favorite
   kernel configuration tool (<b>xconfig</b>, <b>menuconfig</b> etc)
   and follow the path indicated below.
 </p><p>
   (Be aware that the 2.4.x series of kernels do not have a <tt class="verb">mppe</tt> option by
   default but you can download the MPPE module separately from
   <a href="http://mppe-mppc.alphacron.de/">http://mppe-mppc.alphacron.de/</a>
   and patch various kernels or patch <b>pppd</b>
   and rebuild it with MPPE support. Examples of how to accomplish this are
   given on the site).
 </p><p>
   If you use a 2.6.x kernel then the steps below will give you MPPE support.
 </p>
 <pre class="listing">
  Device Drivers  ---&gt;
    Network device support  ---&gt;
       &lt;M&gt; PPP (point-to-point protocol) support 
       [*]   PPP multilink support (EXPERIMENTAL)
       [*]   PPP filtering
       &lt;M&gt;   PPP support for async serial ports 
       &lt;M&gt;   PPP support for sync tty ports
       &lt;M&gt;   PPP Deflate compression
       &lt;M&gt;   PPP BSD-Compress compression 
       &lt;M&gt;   PPP MPPE compression (encryption) (EXPERIMENTAL)</pre>
 <p>
   The more astute amongst you will notice I have 
   <tt class="verb">&lt;M&gt;&nbsp;PPP&nbsp;Deflate&nbsp;compression</tt>
   and
   <tt class="verb">&lt;M&gt;&nbsp;PPP&nbsp;BSD-Compress&nbsp;compression</tt>
   as part of my kernel
   build but do not use them when calling <b>pppd</b>.
   This is because there are
   times when those options for <b>pppd</b>
   will be needed so by building them at
   the start they are there for use when we need them.
 </p><p>
   Once your kernel is ready we need to configure PPP.  For <b>pppd</b>
   we need to
   edit or create 3 files. These are namely <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/options.pptp</tt>,
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/peers/$TUNNEL</tt> and 
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt>. So, let's start by
   editing or creating <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/options.pptp</tt>.
   Use your preferred editor and
   open <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/options.pptp</tt>
   (we use <tt class="verb">option.pptp</tt> here as a way to
   differentiate it from the normal options file. That way if you use <b>pppd</b>
   to connect to your ISP then the normal options file is there to use and
   when we need to tunnel to our VPN server we have the <tt class="verb">options.pptp</tt>
   available). The <tt class="verb">options.pptp</tt> file should contain the following
 </p>
 <pre class="listing">
   lock
   noauth
   nobsdcomp
   nodeflate</pre>
 <p>
   Now we need to open or create a <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/peers/$TUNNEL</tt> file.
   <tt class="verb">$TUNNEL</tt> can
   be any name you wish to remember which MS VPN server you are connecting
   to. I usually call my <tt class="verb">$TUNNEL</tt> file the same name as who I am
   connecting
   to so, in this example I use <tt class="verb">wrights</tt>. So open or create
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/peers/$TUNNEL</tt>. This file contains the following.
 </p>
 <pre class="listing">
   pty "pptp $IP --nolaunchpppd"
   name $LOGINNAME
   remotename PPTP
   require-mppe-128
   file /etc/ppp/options.pptp
   ipparam $TUNNEL</pre>
 <p>
   Save this file as <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/peers/wrights</tt>.
 </p><p>
   The <tt class="verb">$IP</tt> above should be set to whatever the MS VPN server
   IP/domainname
   is and <tt class="verb">$LOGINNAME</tt> set to whatever the login username is to
   login to the
   MS VPN server. The <tt class="verb">ipparam</tt> is set to whatever you called the
   peers file.
   In this example that was <tt class="verb">wrights</tt>.
   It can be named anything.  So let us create that file now.
 </p><p>
   Open, or create <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/peers/wrights</tt>.
 </p><p>
   Finally, we need to set up the <tt class="verb">chap-secrets</tt> file. So using
   your preferred
   editor open or create <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt>.
 </p><p>
   This file holds the account details thus:</p>
 <pre class="listing">
   # client    server      secret      ip addresses
     Ben       PPTP        millychip      *</pre>
 <p>
   The above is a standard PPP peers file but for completion I will explain
   what is what within that file. <tt class="verb">Ben</tt> is the username
   which you should of been given by the MS VPN administrator.
   <tt class="verb">PPTP</tt> the protocol type
   (it should always be <tt class="verb">PPTP</tt>).
   <tt class="verb">millychip</tt> the user password, again this should of
   been given to you by the MS VPN administrator and
   the&nbsp;<tt class="verb">*</tt> at the end
   signifies take whatever IP the VPN server says to use.
 </p><p>
   Once these three files are in place run this:
 </p><pre class="listing">
   sh /usr/doc/ppp-2.4.4/scripts/pon wrights debug dump logfd 2 nodetach</pre>
 <p>
   '<b>man pppd</b>' will tell you what the options after '<tt class="verb">wrights</tt>'
   do but
   basically they keep <b>pppd</b> in the foreground so we can see what is going
   on.
 </p><p>
   The script file '<tt class="verb">pon</tt>' and its companion '<tt class="verb">poff</tt>'
   are two scripts that come
   with <b>pppd</b>.
   They are useful when you do not keep <b>pppd</b> in the foreground.
   As you can see above I call the file from its location but you can move
   '<tt class="verb">pon</tt>' and '<tt class="verb">poff</tt>' to somewhere in your <tt class="verb">$PATH</tt>
   for ease of use.
 </p><p>
   This should then connect to the MS VPN server and bring up ppp0 with an
   IP assigned by the MS VPN server. You can check that ppp0 is up and
   working with <b>/sbin/ifconfig</b>.
 </p><p>
   When you know everything is working fine you can drop the
   <tt class="verb">debug dump logfd 2</tt> and <tt class="verb">nodetach</tt>.
 </p><p>
   There is also a <b>pptpconfig</b> application which aids in setting
   up <b>pptp</b> but
   I could not get that to  work AT ALL. However, doing it manually is not
   difficult and it worked first time.
