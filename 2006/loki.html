<h3 id="guitars">My guitars</h3>

<p>
Though for the last recordings I've used the <a href="http://www.musicgearreview.com/review-display/8305.html">Yamaha RGX-312</a>, <a href="#Freyja">Freyja</a>, 
I still have 3 other guitars that survived (mostly) thru the years I played them, on
and off the road.
</p>

<h4>
Sigidegun
</h4>

<p>
The ancestor is an &quot;<a href="http://reviews.harmony-central.com/reviews/Guitar/brand/Emperador">Emperador</a>&quot;
I bought in 1976, second hand, almost the kind
depicted in <a href="http://www.foreigneronline.com/jukebox.php">&quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; (Foreigner)</a>.
</p>

<p>
I already had killed one jazz guitar, wounded a classical and severed a
Spanish but that one was my first electric guitar.
</p>

<p> For someone inclined to play hard that was a funny choice, it was a
semi-hollow, third width case with a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigsby">&quot;Bigsby&quot;</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo_arm">tremolo bar</a>
and a sunburn decoration with big square mother of pearl fret inlays
on the fingerboard and glossy golden and silver rotative knobs. </p>

<p> That was a hell of a look, maybe that's the reason why I sort of
liked a small emerging band of that era named &quot;The New York
Dolls&quot; ;-) </p>

<p> The look of this guitar was frantic for someone whose first band had
the inspired name of &quot;Hard Nardchic&quot; (and that's no typo) but
the sound was even hellier. </p>

<p id="mikes"> For any reader who knows a little bit about electric guitars having
a hollow body and a &quot;Bigsby&quot; and
<a href="./lokis_remarks.html#mikes">single-coiled mikes</a> <b>and</b>
using a fuzz <b>and</b> overdrive is a real stallion to mate when it
starts a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback">Larsen feedback</a> which,
thanks to the &quot;Bigsby&quot; will be
here to last and, thanks to the hollow body will happen any time you try
to play a note and have forgotten to sit bareback on the neck. </p>

<p id="whackywhoop"> Well, I sort of tamed the thing by adding a wha-wha pedal to my set
so I could block the feedback with a
<a href="./lokis_remarks.html#whackywhoop">whackywhoop</a> any old time,
I also used the 
<a href="./lokis_remarks.html#whammy">whammy</a>
bar to this effect but the trouble with a
&quot;Bigsby&quot; is that even when you almost happened to tune up the
guitar at the start you'll never find it again as soon as you touch the
<a href="./lokis_remarks.html#tremolo">tremolo</a> bar... </p>

<p> I named this axe &quot;Sigidegun&quot;, in plain English that's be
something like &quot;victorious blade&quot; and I swear it was far from a
lie, this blade probably killed thousand ears a week in glorious
whinnyings! </p>

<p id="Nashville"> Ah, I forgot another usual mistake I <b>also</b> made at the time, I
used very ultra light gauged strings, something like
'<a href="./lokis_remarks.html#Nashville">Nashville 8-36</a>'
(yes, I believe this won't exist anymore :D) The only advantage that it
gave to the audience was the strings frequently broke or at least went
out of their path so the poor guys had a chance to listen to the bass and
drums progressive method to find the beat while the keyboards was testing
the jacks while soldering a spare one with chewing-gum. </p>


<h4 id="Freyja">
Freyja
</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyja">She</a>'s
the one I used the most by now, I bought it about twenty years ago
because I really wanted to have a 24 notes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fretboard">fretboard</a>
and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Rose">Floyd Rose</a> tremolo system.
I tested many of the possible ones. (I was living in Paris-Blanche at this time
and that's the place to go to find electric guitars so it was easy for me to
spend time testing different models.) In the end I had to choose between the two
guitars that suited me the best, either a
<a href="http://www.vigierguitars.com/France/GCatalog/Gve6SL.htm">Vigier Excalibur</a>
or a Yamaha RGX 312.
</p>
<p>  For some reason the hand-crafted Vigier was much more expensive than the
industrialized Japanese model so I bought the one that did cost a third of my
monthly income instead of trying to steal a guitar the worth of a semester.
  Sometimes I see a few Excalibur in second-hand shops and I feel like buying
one (or two ;-) but until now I always managed to resist!
</p>
<p>Anyway, I then have this RGX 312, cherry red (or &quot;raspberry&quot;). It is light, well
balanced and the fretboard is fast, it's a funny mix that this guitar has with its
&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Stratocaster">Strat</a>
family&quot; shape but a short (~620 mm) neck. The tremolo system is stable and precise,
its only default was the handle has a tendency to slip off its hole,
so I cured that with a small piece of plastic tape, customizing, that's what you get with
industrial products :-) I also added a strip of &quot;Velcro&quot; to keep my guitar picks handy
instead of having to use old usual tricks like having half a dozen in each cheek (which
for a singing guitar player is not the easiest part, nor the healthier).  
</p>
<p>Later, I customized again by adding a &quot;hexamike&quot; (GK-2A) for the VG-8 control,
I made the same for Sigidegun so on stage I had a spare that could be plugged
in the VG-8, I also kept Hel in desperate spare, ready to plug it in any DI box
in case everything went normal (that is, nothing works).
</p>
<p>The 12 pieces of the set
&quot;<a href="http://l0k1.free.fr/adirtydozen-en.html">A Dirty Dozen</a>&quot;
were played on Freyja.
</p>

<h4>
Hel
</h4>

<p> Years later I bought a guitar dedicated to rehearsals, it is a
<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/n.roche/HohnerSteinberger.htm">&quot;Hohner-Steinberger&quot;</a>
model, neckless and tailless, easy to carry in the subway. It though was
a bit of a challenging one to play as it uses a long (like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Musical_Instruments_Corporation">Fenders</a>)
fingerboard unlike my other guitars that all had a short
(like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Guitar_Corporation">Gibsons</a>) one.</p>

<p> That's a cinch when you just play rhythmics (though you'll have to
train a little bit for some position changes) but that can be a real
wrist terminator when you go for speed soloing&nbsp;:D) </p>

<p>About two thirds of the guitars in
&quot;<a href="http://l0k1.free.fr/thestarsarecruel.html">The Stars are Cruel</a>&quot;
were played on Hel.
</p>

<p> Anyway, I still love to play this guitar from time to time, it has a
real soul of its own, only trouble is finding correct double-balled
strings, and not only because they cost about thrice the price of
standards but I really found a difference in global quality since 1995,
don't know if that's related to the usual cause of world company beliefs
in outsourcing... </p>

<p> I named this one 'Hel', doesn't need a translation (the last child
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki">I</a> had, with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angrboda">Angroboda</a>&nbsp; ;-)
</p>

<h4>
Noname guitar
</h4>

<p> I also have an 'electro' guitar, an
<a href="http://www.voes.be/guitars/ae20/index.html">Ibanez AE20</a> 
I do string with classical 13-56 bronze and nylon sets which gives a mellow
and precise sound. This guitar, with this set of strings, is almost as
hard to play as a double-bass but it's worth the effort. I'm not certain
if it can be heard in pieces I put on the site, I sort of reserved its
use to records and concerts with
<a href="http://20100l.free.fr/indexN.html">Vincent&nbsp;L.</a> </p>

<p> I never gave a name to this guitar, though I like to use it for
composing or quickly checking an idea I guess I'm really deeply
electrically  switched and this guitar is just a friend and not a child
or a lover, I suppose the intrumentists here will know what I'm talking
about but I had to know that many people think that's 9 points to Forest
Lawn in your circuitry. </p>

<h3 id="vg8">
FX set, the Roland VG-8
</h3>

<p> I bought this FX compact set the month it arrived in my town, it was
a real impulsive buy and I never regretted it :-) It uses sound
modelization devices/progs to transform the capture, from the special
mike, not as usual at this time in MIDI to feed a sound expander, but
directly as the &quot;matrix&quot; of the modelized sound. </p>

<p> This means your way of picking, strumming, tapping, hammering,
anything you do to the guitar will go into the sound, and the sound can
be a lot of different things with the 
<a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/publications/sweetnotes/sn-winter96/WinterSN_15.html">models built in the VG-8</a>!
The main models are for guitars and guitar amps but you'll also have
flute/organ/synty/brass, note that using an organ model will not turn
your guitar in an organ as the structure of the sound is deeply dependent
of its matrix. </p>

<p> Though by learning how to pick and strum in special ways to reproduce
the intonation of an instrument you can simulate a lot the real organ or
brass, but if it was a question of hours to make a correct mock of the
'Child in time' organ intro I never could simulate the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_565">Toccatta
in D minor</a>&nbsp;!-) </p>

<p> Anyway, I use this FX to access different guitar and amps models,
like having a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecaster">Telecaster</a>
on a Tweed for the main guitar and instantly
switch it to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_SG">SG</a>
on a 4 set Marshall with fuzz and overdrive (some tastes never change ;-)
for the solo. </p>

<p> This is a very versatile pedalier and the only detail in it that made
me nervous was the hexamike cable is big, heavy, rigid and fragile (and
expensive), so if on stage I used a long (15m) one I always had my two
rehearsal cables (5m) at hand. Now I don't play on stage anymore I'm less
anxious with them but it was a bad point. </p>

<p> Still I have to thank the Roland people that made this piece of art
of an FX combo, it is a real pleasure to use the VG-8 :-) </p>

<p>In case someone wants gory details on the GK-2A hexamike, here's a link to
<a href="http://vg-8.com/files/manuals/GK-2A_Manual.pdf">RTFM</a> ;D)
</p>

<h3 id="beer">
Beer
</h3>

<p> That's certainly, besides the ego and the guitar, the vital part of
the heart of a guitar player! </p>

<p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead">Mead</a> was the only
real improvement man invented, the astrophysics is a laugh and central
heating is a shame,
'<a href="http://2006gc.blogspot.com/2006/05/angsoc.html">angsoc</a>' was
already debated in 1948 and we're left with no
'<a href="http://www.webster-dictionary.net/d.aspx?w=soc">soc</a>' and just
the '<a href="http://dictionary.laborlawtalk.com/Angst">angst</a>'
remains. </p>

<p>
Beer will help you!
</p>
<p>
Only Beer can help you!
</p>

<p> It is improbable to ever find a guitar player that would spend eight
hours drinking wine or whisky, or whatever beverage ever made on Earth
and still be able to play anything, actually this poor soul will have
difficulties in even telling the name of the band he was playing just a
few minutes ago before he'd been fired from tour by the manager who was
upset you didn't find the singer (in the backgarden with groupies and
coke) nor the bass player (down the pool with crystals and not a drop to
drink.) </p>

<p> I know that for being a beta-tester of human errors a few years, my
callisthenics helped a little bit and hazard did the rest of it. </p>

<p> Now, as we know &quot;Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker&quot; and
we're not in a hurry to run a big end, here's a short list of my
&quot;Beer&quot; tastes :-) </p>

<h4>
Guinness
</h4>

<p> I know, it's not &quot;a beer&quot; but I really love stouts and
loving stouts lead to extreme deviances like being in awe with Guinness
and totally junked off with &quot;Eku Kulminator&quot;. </p>

<h4>
Bitters
</h4>

<p> That'll be quite impossible to explain to readers that never crossed
a land were brewing was a living body and not just a market share living
corpse. I don't know the real reasons why there was no way to even ever
hear about the name 'Bitter' in &quot;France&quot; though this place
(Europe) has been flooded since Caesar designed the coppers to be a must
when addicted to hard wine then exported vine 'savvy' :-) </p>

<p> Anyway, I'd recommend to &quot;historically deprived people&quot; to
test a &quot;Bitter&quot; brew and send complaints to the heads of their
states ;-) </p>

<h4>
Ale
</h4>

<p> I'll admit I enjoyed some ales, to my record I'd defend that I barely
had occasions to test some, this directly leads to the point &quot;yes,
there are some advantages to live in Britain&quot; ;-) Anyway, there
remains in France two (different GL indexed) beers that, like
&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale">Ale</a>&quot;
I feel like modern &quot;Meads&quot;. </p>

<p> I had this feeling with a few &quot;cervezas&quot; in Spain but that
was 1978 and I've never been around here anymore (well, I actually made
a trip to &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Country">Catalan Country</a>&quot;
but it's now so sad to see them warp off
to a clinical world of &quot;give the goof a Hein<tt>.*</tt>&quot;. </p>

<h4>
Lager
</h4>

<p> There are a few possible
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager">lagers</a> around, sigh...
Tribute to the worst, Hein<tt>.*</tt> leads the world of lagers, you won't see me
drinking any, actually in case you believe I am about to pick one and
eventually drink some of it please give me some sugar or call out for
the firemen to help me ;D) </p>

<h3 id="linux">
Linux (in musical gear)
</h3>

<p> Bad score on this topic. I use 'alsaplayer' and 'mplayer' to listen
to stuff but on the side of 'producing/composing/playing' I still have to
make the final leap. </p>

<p> For 'mastering/checking' I've used
'<a href="http://rezound.sourceforge.net/">ReZound</a>' with
<a href="http://www.ladspa.org/">LADSPA</a>/<a href="http://jackaudio.org/">Jackit</a>
and I really believe it's not far to be better than the Win32 equivalents
in function (e.g. Steinberg's Wavelab). </p>

<p> Still, fact that I've not yet used Linux for recording/composing is
not a commitment on the topic, as I have my time shared a lot between
different functions/passions/duty my time to kill is zilch. Learning to
use a software for recording is not a huge task but learning how to use
it and be comfortable with it to the point it is just another instrument
in the process of creation is a long walk. </p>

<p> For a long time I've been using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emagic">Emagic</a>'s Logic Audio,
I started on using their products with 'Creator' like twenty years ago, it
was on Atari 68K and 68K30 machines that I used for composition (et al)
even when I finally had x86 machines at home, around April Y2K, which I used only
to have access to the Internet with better results than those given by
the sloppy covers of browsers (the Atari line was dead since a long time
then and no company was taking the risk of a bet it'd rise up again) </p>

<p> So I eventually (in 2002) bought the
<a href="http://messe.harmony-central.com/Musikmesse01/Content/Emagic/PR/Logic-Audio-5.html">Logic 5</a>
and spend a few weeks porting my files and samples from LA2.1 to LAW5 and
some songs are now really lost because it was at that time I moved to my
actual apartment and some &quot;historical&quot; tapes were lost or
stealed in the move. Yes, shit happens, it's not a big deal for me as I
still have these &quot;lost songs&quot; in my remaining brain cells but
(bring on the horns and trombones now) they may miss to somebody :-) </p>

<p> I tested several supposed to be FLOSS
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubase">Cubases</a>, though I didn't
like Cubase I thought that it'd be a miracle any concurrent project that
heavy would start in the line of Logic Audio :-)<br> I was interested in
<a href="http://brahms.sourceforge.net/">Brahms</a> but it died soon,
then I tried Jazz and
<a href="http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/">Rosegarden</a> and this latter
gave me a hope that it'd be a possible way in the future but it wasn't
stable enough and, even more important, not easy to use without being a
programmer, sincerely the interface was struggling against the user !-)
</p>

<p> That was a few years ago and things were complicated by the fact to
have to compile a specific kernel, compile the ALSA and Jackit stuff with
the best possible optimizations and I even added a stochastic factor in
using a laptop, especially a Vaio one, and put an external USB card. </p>

<p> Then you can imagine that it was an inferno each time I tried an
update of any part of the software, so I sort of decided to wait it was
much more mature or that I'd have much more time to kill, I already had
at work a load of IT to cope with that filled all my need to play with
numbers and code ;-) </p>

<p> I recently tested the version 1.4.0 and I think it is becoming
interesting and quite usable, from a point of view of capabilities I'd
say it's about what a Cubase did circa 2001-2002. Considering the
difference of money and developers involved in the two projects, that's
not so bad! </p>

<p> So, I believe I'll try and produce my next songs with Rosegarden and
I'll only use Logic in case I can't achieve a specific need that's not
yet available in FLOSS (like some plugin FX distributed with Logic Audio).
</p>

<h3 id="record">
Recording process
</h3>

<p> I don't have a very rigid chart of tasks when I start a song. In fact
some songs were written years before to finally have a second verse and a
coda and some even changed of lyrics thru the years, and to be fair some
lyrics changed of music as well but this was more due to the style of the
musicians playing in it, including my own changes of style in playing the
guitar. </p>

<p>
For the last record,
&quot;<a href="http://l0k1.free.fr/adirtydozen-en.html">A Dirty Dozen</a>&quot;
it was a bit simpler, as the process was to be as close as possible of
ultra-fast composition/recording, a bit like deciding to produce an album
in four or six group rehersals. </p>

<p> I was alone, that was a disadvantage in the way I had to do every
part but at least it saved me time as I didn't have to wait hours to
listen to the last excuse from the drummer to be late and I didn't have
to boil liters of salty coffee to wake the bass player up... </p>

<p> Then, I first decided the titles for the 12 pieces, I tossed a dice
twice to chose which one was the first to go, decided the type of guitar
and amp I wanted to play and lit up the keyboards. </p>

<p> I then recorded an entire bass line on a metronome, then replaced the
click with drums (played on keyboards), the bass was sometimes played on
the guitar but more were just played on keyboards. </p>

<p> Then I rehearsed the guitar by improvising freely on two to five
entire plays of the piece, each time selecting in my mind what I thought
sounded the best and meanwhile tried and organize which picking/strumming
was the best for the general feeling of the sound of the piece (e.g.,
sweeping here and tapping there). </p>

<p> Finally I recorded this rehearsed guitar, one take, like on stage,
though I admit on some I had to do the take two or three times and on one
(no, I won't say which one it is !-) I made a correction to one pulled
note that went oddly but the rest of the take was so great to my ears
that I didn't feel like trashing it :-) </p>

<p> The rest was mixing and mastering, Logic Audio and ReZound, then the
hard disk with the mixes and pre-masters went bozo and I did it all
again... </p>

<h3 id="band">
Your Rock Band in a few easy steps
</h3>

<p>
<b>What you need :</b>
</p>
<ul>

<li>1 song (you don't want to be another 80's band)</li>
<li>1 voice !</li>
<li>1 guitar (and I mean ONE! having a couple may sound interesting but
	you'll spend more time trying to stop them fighting or,
	even worse, if they mate you'll never hear the rest of the band)</li>
<li>1 bass, could be the frustrated guitar</li>
<li>1 PUMmer and sometimes 1 TCHACKer, can be a foot stomping as well
	<ul>
	<li>- catch-1: The PUMmer can be the TCHACKer too, in case he's
		not the usual mal-coo</li>
	<li>- catch-2: In case of serious TCHACKer shortage, a groupie
		can be turned in to a CLAPper, but you start this
		kinda facility and you'll soon get caught in the
		local Top of the Pops, might be serious damage for 
		a rock band.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>1 noise, usually the singer, sometimes the guitarist when (s)he's a
	frustrated singer.
	<ul>
	<li>- catch-1: Use the groupie(s)</li>
	<li>- catch-2: No, don't even think about this HiHat!</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Song is made out off these, never indulge, never think about mixing it up
later, never pray on the 'mastering magic'. PLAY!
</p>

<p> Whatever he says don't try to listen to the drummer, it <b>never</b>
works. Instead, kindly help him to find the  correct tempo and lead him
to the understanding of the  rythm, try to mask his small blurs, if he
gets into big blurs stop playing at once and let's pretend it's a <b>drum
solo</b>. </p>

<p> If the drum solo lasts more than the time you can drink a fresh beer,
whack the insane with a twist of your doublebass head. While he tries to
find his seat and sticks, have your famous bass solo. </p>
