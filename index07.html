<p><strong>Laurens Vets</strong> has kindly let us know about a small
<a href="http://www.cilinder.be/2007/11/14/building-slackware-vservers-on-slackware.html">HOWTO</a>
on setting up a <a href="http://linux-vserver.org/">Linux-VServer</a> on Slackware&nbsp;12.0.
Thanks Laurens!</p>

<p>For those (of us) who haven't tried Linux-VServer, here is its brief
description taken from <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/3380">SecurityFocus</a>:
Linux-VServer allows you to create virtual private servers and security
contexts which operate like a normal Linux server, but allow many
independent servers to be run simultaneously in one box at full speed.
All services, such as ssh, mail, Web, and databases, can be started on
such a VPS, without modification, just like on any real server. Each
virtual server has its own user account database and root password and
doesn't interfere with other virtual servers.</p>

<p><strong>TG</strong> has kindly let us know about
a <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/the_perfect_desktop_slackware12">tutorial</a> 
published by <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/">HowtoForge</a> 
in their &quot;Perfect Desktop&quot; series and dedicated to Slackware 12.0.
The tutorial covers different aspects of running Slack, from its installation
and basic setup to configuring KDE and adding programs not present
in the stock setup.  The text discusses different ways of adding
packages and provides real-life examples.  
The tutorial is likely to be aimed at new users of Slackware but
even a more experienced slacker may probably benefit from reading it.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="./hearts.html#grant">Grant Coady</a>
<a href="./2007/vmware.html">shared his experience</a> on 
setting up and using a VMware server.  As was pointed out in
the article, one had to patch VMware server 1.0.3 in order to
make it work with kernels more recent than 2.6.19.x.
Yesterday, Dieter Manstein kindly let us know that this is
no more the case for the VMware server 1.0.4,
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/releases/262943/">released recently</a>.
Thanks Dieter for the useful information!</p>

<p>Other interesting news has come from the 
<a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/">Puppy Linux</a> project.
Puppy Linux is a nice live CD project, with its own
userbase and its pretty own style.  A surprising thing is
that its latest release is built to be binary compatible with Slackware&nbsp;12.0.
More can be found in the 
<a href="http://www.puppylinux.com/download/release-3.00.htm">release notes</a>.
IMHO, this is another sign of Slackware being recognized by the Linux
community as one of the best distributions available.
</p>

<p>
Actually, the best one but we don't often take time to tell the Linux
community how good Slackware is ;-)
Luckily, there are persons like Gary Maxwell, who has written an article
<a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/93393/">Slackware: the classic distro that's as timely as ever</a>,
published recently by <a href="http://lxer.com/">LXer</a>.
Thanks Gary!  Our thanks are also addressed to Manuel Otto, who posted 
information about the article on AOLS.</p>

<p>Finally, I'd like to mention an article 
<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/119025">30 days with JFS</a> by
Keith Winston, published in mid September by <a href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux.com</a>.
As we all know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFS_%28file_system%29">JFS</a>
is one of the file systems supported by Slackware. Unfortunately, information
on JFS is comparatively poor. In the article, Keith Winston shares his
(positive) experience on using JFS in Slackware&nbsp;12.</p>

<p>Niki Kovacs, one of the AOLS regulars, is studying the possibility of 
building a very lean system similar to one that can be built using 
<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux From Scratch</a> but on 
the basis of packages that come with Slackware. The first results of the 
investigation are presented in the writeup called 
<a href="http://slackwiki.org/Linux_From_Slack">Linux From Slack</a>. :-)
</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> According to the recent announcement, the above page
will soon merge into the newly created
<a href="http://slackwiki.org/Minimal_System">Minimal System</a> project.</p>

<p>Dear Slackers:</p>

<p>
The first review of the brand new Slackware-12.0 is
<a href="2007/slackware-12.0.html">here</a>.
We hope you will not only enjoy reading this writeup by 
<a href="hearts.html#michielvwessem">Michiel van Wessem</a>

<p>Slackware -current supports installation on encrypted partitions
and logical volumes!</p>
<p>As one could have noticed, 
<a href="./hearts.html#alien">Eric Hameleers</a> has written two excellent
writeups for the -current branch. These are 
`Installing Slackware on encrypted volumes' (README_CRYPT.TXT) and
`Installing Slackware on Logical volumes' (README_LVM.TXT), both available
in the root directory of <tt>slackware-current</tt>.  Yesterday I tried
the first of them and I can witness that it works. :-)</p>

<p>The only thing I had to change was setting the &quot;<tt>boot=</tt>&quot;
line in <tt>lilo.conf</tt> to read <tt>boot=/dev/hda</tt> instead of
<tt>boot=/dev/hda1</tt> that I thought to be right after studying the writeup.
This minor mistake gave me an interesting experience of using
Slackware installation DVD as a rescue disk for an encrypted system. :-)
Once again, Eric's writeup occurred to be useful because the procedure 
used during installation was applicable in that situation, too.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the July'07 issue of the Linux Gazette
contains two articles on the same subject:
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/140/kapil.html">Setting up an Encrypted Debian System</a>,
by Kapil Hari Paranjape, and
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/140/pfeiffer.html">Encrypted Storage with LUKS, RAID and LVM2</a>,
by Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer.  It is remarkable that Eric Hameleers published his articles prior to
Linux Gazette :-)</p>

<p>
Suppose you need to run both Slackware Linux and another OS
on the same machine.  Dual booting provides a well-established
solution. Still, there is another way to accomplish the task.
Namely, to run a virtual machine.  In his
<a href="http://slackworld.berlios.de/2007/vmware.html">new article</a>,
Grant Coady shares his experience of running the latest VMware Server.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!

<p>Have you found a moment to relax and have a little rest?
Go read
<a href="http://www.linux.com/articles/114286?tid=16">Debain WrEtch: review of an UnAmerican Linux system</a>
at Linux.com. Well, it's not about Slack but I think it's still fun :-)</p>

<p>Dear fellow slackers,</p>
<p>We are continuing our <em>Persona Grata</em> series.
This time, our guest is Robby Workman, one of the founders
and maintainers of the <a href="http://slackbuilds.org">SlackBuilds.org</a>
project, an active member of the Slackware community, and just
a nice person.  An interview with Robby Workman can be found
<a href="./2007/robby_workman.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>In early March, <a href="./hearts.html#grant">Grant Coady</a> became a
happy owner of a brand new 64-bit PC.  Definitely, he couldn't stand
trying 64-bit forks of Slackware.
<a href="./2007/slack_64-bit_world.html">Here</a>
one can find a brief diary of the first few days of Grant's life in the
slack 64-bit world.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>&quot;<b>chroot</b> - run command or interactive shell with special

does it?  Go read <a href="./2007/chroot_howto.html">A How To on Creating

<p>Some time ago, we, the editors, got to know about a couple of
&quot;Slackware Francophone&quot; sites.  Unfortunately, nobody of
us reads French. <a href="./hearts.html#loki">Loki Harfagr</a> has
kindly agreed to review them for us and&nbsp;... for you. :-)
<a href="./2007/loki_on_slackfr.org.html">Here</a> is a review of
<a href="http://slackfr.org">SlackFR.org</a>. Thank you, Loki!</p>

<p>We are very glad to let you know that one more person has joined
the Slack World team.
This is <a href="./hearts.html#tomnewsom">Tom Newsom</a>, a Slackware user since
1993!  Tom begins his participation in the project with
<a href="./2007/Linux2MS-VPN.html">A quickie on how to set up a Linux to MS VPN</a>,
and one can expect more Tom's HOWTOs to appear in the future.</p>

<p>Kurt H Maier has kindly attracted our attention to
<a href="http://www.develia.org/">develia.org</a>, a nice
Slackware-related web site maintained by Giacomo&nbsp;Lozito.
Develia.org is
&quot;a public archive containing software and libraries of various types,
everything optimized for i686 architecture and intended to work properly
on systems updated to slackware-current.&quot;
Develia.org also hosts a number of <a href="http://www.develia.org/projects.php?l=2&amp;f=1">software projects</a>
and <a href="http://www.develia.org/documents.php?l=2&amp;f=1">documentation</a>
for UNIX-like systems.</p>

<p>The site lead us to the discovery of
<a href="http://pkgsummon.sourceforge.net/">PKGsummon</a>, a GTK+-2-based
program for the management of Slackware Linux tarballs.
According to the author, PKGsummon allows one to rapidly compare the
versions of installed packages with those available on ftp mirrors, and
to browse contents of the packages installed on system.</p>

<p>The last week was full of Slackware-related &quot;discoveries&quot;&nbsp;:-)
First, I found a number of great Brazilian
sites dedicated to Slackware.  Unfortunately for me, they are mostly in
Portuguese but I think they are worth looking at even in case you
don't know this language.   The first one to mention is
<a href="http://slack.sarava.org/">slack.sarava.org</a>.
The site contains a great repository
of Slackware <a href="http://slack.sarava.org/packages/slackware/">packages</a> and <a href="http://slack.sarava.org/slackbuilds/">build scripts</a>
(as well as those for <a href="http://slack.sarava.org/packages/slamd64">Slamd64</a>
and <a href="http://slack.sarava.org/packages/slackintosh/">Slackintosh</a>).
The project also maintains <a href="http://slack.sarava.org/node/15">Simplepkg</a>,
&quot;a non-intrusive package management system running on top of pkgtool.&quot;
Two other sites that I found to be interesting are
<a href="http://www.slacklife.com.br/">Slacklife</a> and
<a href="http://www.slackwarezine.com.br/">Slackware Zine</a>.
</p>

<p>Besides this, I found
<a href="http://delili.lens.hl-users.com/cruxports4slack.html">CruxPorts4Slack</a>,
a project that allows one to use the <a href="http://crux.nu/portdb/">ports system of Crux</a>
in Slackware. The project is maintained by one of the develovers
of <a href="http://delili.lens.hl-users.com/">DeLi Linux</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I have found <a href="http://poiroud.free.fr/linux/slackbuild/">one more repository</a>
of Slackware build scripts.  This one is maintained by Marc Poiroud.
I seems the Slackware community could benefit much of
a searchable database of such projects.</p>

<p><a href="./hearts.html#grant">Grant Coady</a> has recently updated his
<a href="http://bugsplatter.mine.nu/junkview/">junkview</a> project. A number
of new features are added, a minor bug is fixed.</p>

<p>The last news for today is
an <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070113/bob9.asp">article</a>
published by <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/">Science News</a>.
The article is devoted to digital &quot;fingerprints&quot;, and
how tiny differences in the ways people type, browse web sites, and
write messages can reveal their identities.</p>

<p>The New Year holidays is a good time to read long-postponed articles
and books&nbsp;:-)  I'll briefly comment on a number of web resources and
articles I studied with pleasure.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ams.org">American Mathematical Society</a>
publishes <a href="http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/">Monthly Essays on Mathematical Topics</a>.
I have found a couple of essays related to the Internet.
These are <a href="http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/internet.html">Mathematics
and Internet Security</a> by Joe&nbsp;Malkevitch and
<a href="http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/pagerank.html">How Google
Finds Your Needle in the Web's Haystack</a> by David&nbsp;Austin.
The essays are written clearly and do not require any knowledge
of higher mathematics.</p>

<p>
Two articles on simple Samba setups on Slackware 11 appeared
in November.  These were
<a href="http://www.foogazi.com/2006/11/01/simple-samba-slackware-setup/">Simple Samba Slackware Setup</a>
by adam&nbsp;k, the maintainer of <a href="http://www.foogazi.com/">Foogazi</a>, and
<a href="http://www.linux.com/articles/58593">Quick and dirty Samba setup</a>
by Joel Nahrgang.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.g-loaded.eu/">G-Loaded!</a>
is another Linux- and open-source-related journal.
It both publishes original articles and provides links to articles
by other authors.  Among writeups that attracted my attention
were articles on 
<a href="http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/11/24/auto-closing-ssh-tunnels/">auto-closing SSH tunnels</a>
and a few possible ways of
<a href="http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/11/06/netcat-a-couple-of-useful-examples/">
using netcat</a>, and a (linked) article on 
<a href="http://www.heise-security.co.uk/articles/82481">how Skype&amp;Co. get round firewalls</a>
published by <a href="http://www.heise-security.co.uk/">heise Security</a>.
[Update:
<a href="http://linide.sourceforge.net/nat-traverse/">Nat-traverse</a> seems to
implement the same idea as the one used by Skype thus allowing one to establish
connections between NAT-ed machines.]</p>

<p>Don't forget to check <a href="./links.html">Slack Links</a>.
A number of new links have been added recently!</p>
