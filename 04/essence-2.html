  <h2>Slack Essence-2: What is my IP address?</h2>

  <p>
   <b>Author:</b> Lew Pitcher
  </p>
  <p>
   I have had need, on occasion, to determine the IP address assigned to my PPP
   connection by my ISP, but have been reluctant to code the usually complex
   scripts nececssary to extract this information from the results of the
   '<b>ifconfig</b>' command.
  </p><p>
   Fortunate for lazy me, there's an easy way to determine the PPP IP
   address,  and it's (more or less) built right in to the <b>pppd</b>
   daemon. I simply had the ppp daemon put the IP address in a file, so
   I could read it. Here's the  trick: the ppp daemon runs a script
   called <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt>
   whenever the IP  connection to the ISP is
   established, and another script  (called
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt>) when the
   IP connection is broken.
  </p><p>
   The <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt> and <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt> scripts are invoked with
   several  parameters, including
  </p>
  <ul>
       <li> the name of the logical interface over which the connection has been
         established (eg ppp0, ppp1)</li>
       <li> the name of the physical interface over which the connection has been
         established (eg ttyS0, ttyS1)</li>
       <li> the speed of the interface (it's baud)</li>
       <li> the <em>local</em> IP address (the address assigned to our side of the
         connection)</li>
       <li> the remote IP address (the address assigned to the ISP side of the
         connection), and</li>
       <li> the value set in the ppp configuration's "ipparm" option</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Minor additions to these two scripts will give us exactly the information we
   need: an indicator showing whether an IP address has been assigned or not,
   the value of the assigned IP address, and the date and time when the IP
   address was assigned.
  </p><p>
   Here's how we do it:
  </p><p>
   In <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt>
   (or <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up.local</tt>,
   if your installation supports it) we add these lines:
  </p>
<pre class="quest">
# Create sentinal file
rm /var/run/$1.ip
echo $4 >/var/run/$1.ip
</pre>
  <p>
   and in <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt>
   (or <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down.local</tt>, if your installation 
   supports it) we add:
  </p>
<pre class="quest">
# Delete sentinal file
rm /var/run/$1.ip
</pre>
  <p>
   When <b>pppd</b> establishes an IP session with your ISP, it invokes
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt>,  giving it the interface name
   as parameter&nbsp;$1 and the assigned IP address as 
   parameter&nbsp;$4. The additional lines in <tt
   class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt> will create a file using  the
   interface name, and load that file with the IP address. Assuming that
   you  establish an IP session across (say) interface ppp0, the
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt> script will build a file called
   <tt class="verb">/var/run/ppp0.ip</tt>, and
   put the assigned IP  address into it.
  </p><p>
   When <b>pppd</b> terminates the IP session, it invokes <tt
   class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt>, giving it  the interface name as
   parameter&nbsp;$1. The additional lines in <tt
   class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt>  will use this parameter to select
   and delete the file that records the IP  address for that interface.
  </p><p>
   Now, when the interface is down, and we do not have an IP address,
   there will be no <tt class="verb">/var/run/*.ip</tt> file for the
   interface.
  </p><p>
   When the interface is up, and we don't have an IP address, there will
   still be  no <tt class="verb">/var/run/*.ip</tt> file for the
   interface.
  </p><p>
   However, when the interface is up and we have an IP address, there
   will be  a <tt class="verb">/var/run/*.ip</tt> file, and that file
   will carry as its contents the IP address  assigned to the interface.
   Further, the "last modification date" (<b>mtime</b>) on  the file will
   indicate when the file was written, and thus indicate the time  that
   the IP address was assigned.
  </p><p>
   Knowing this, we can write a simple script that tells us the IP address of any
   ppp interface:
  </p>
<pre class="quest">
#!/bin/bash
IFACE=ppp0

[ "$1" != "" ] && IFACE=$1
IFACE_UC=`echo $IFACE | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'`

if [ -f /var/run/$IFACE.ip ]
then
   SINCE=`ls -l /var/run/$IFACE.ip | awk '{ print $6,"@",$7 }'`
   echo "Yes, $IFACE_UC is UP since $SINCE with IP address " \
        `cat /var/run/$IFACE.ip`
   exit 0
else
   echo "No, $IFACE_UC is DOWN"
   exit 1
fi
</pre>
  <p>
   In use, this script generates results like
  </p>
<pre class="listing">
   lpitcher@merlin:~$ is_ppp_up
   Yes, PPP0 is UP since 2005-10-28 @ 16:55 with IP address  10.99.99.99

   lpitcher@merlin:~$ is_ppp_up ppp1
   No, PPP1 is DOWN</pre>

  <p> Of course, the script can be expanded on to include all those
   sorts of things  that one wants in a robust command (like argument
   checking and better  functionality), but in it's basic form, the
   script provides the answer to the  age-old question "What's my IP
   address?" 
  </p><p>
   There are other methods that you can use to determine your PPP IP address 
   (like greping and awking the results of an "ifconfig ppp0" command, or 
   running a custom program that reads the PPP interfaces IP addresses 
   directly), but these methods don't really satisfy my needs.
  </p><p>
   I have often used <b>pppd</b>'s "dial-on-demand" option to establish
   my internet  connection, and (in that case) <b>pppd</b> is always up. That
   means that ppp0 is  always up, but it usually has the wrong IP
   address. For instance, when I  wrote this, I was not connected to the
   internet. But, <b>ifconfig</b> reported
  </p>
<pre class="listing">
   lpitcher@merlin:~$ /sbin/ifconfig ppp0
   ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
             inet addr:64.99.99.99  P-t-P:64.8.99.1
             Mask:255.255.255.255
             UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
             RX packets:34520 errors:29 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:29
             TX packets:32103 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
             collisions:0 txqueuelen:10</pre>

  <p>
   Note that the <b>ifconfig</b> results indicate that my ppp0 IP address was 
   64.99.99.99. When I started up ppp0, <b>ifconfig</b> reported that it had IP address 
   10.10.10.10
  </p><p>
   In both cases, the IP address reported by <b>ifconfig</b> (and by any other program 
   parsing the parameters of the ppp0 interface) is not the address that ppp0 
   will be assigned when I connect. The only time that <b>ifconfig</b> or another 
   program will accurately report the correct IP address is when ppp0 is 
   connected to my ISP. All other times, the address reported will be wrong.
  </p><p>
   So, to avoid getting the wrong results when my IP connection is down, I use 
   the <tt class="verb">ip-up/ip-down</tt> scripts to record the actual IP address assigned at the 
   time of connection (or whenever the IP address is renegotiated).
