  <h2>Persona Grata: Lew Pitcher</h2>

  <p>
   There is no need to introduce <b>Lew Pitcher</b> to regulars of
   alt.os.linux.slackware, comp.os.linux.security, and as you will
   soon get to know to readers of about 30(!) other computer-related
   newsgroups.
   To all others (are there any?), we just
   recommend to read on.
   For everybody, we also recommend
   to check <a href="./essence-1.html">Slack Essence-1</a>
   and <a href="./essence-2.html">Slack Essence-2</a> by Lew Pitcher
   in the current issue of <em>The Slack World</em> as well as
   his materials in <a href="../01/wisdom.html">the first</a> and 
   <a href="../02/wisdom.html#lew">the second</a> issues of our webzine.
  </p>

  <p>
   Now you see, why Lew.
   We promise
   you <em>will</em> enjoy reading the interview kindly given to us
   by Lew&nbsp;Pitcher.
  </p>

  <hr>
  <p><em>The Slack World:
  0. Lew, could you please tell us and our readers a bit about yourself?
     As far as one can figure out from the signatures of your posts on
     AOLS, you are working as an "IT Specialist, Enterprise Data
     Systems, Enterprise Technology Solutions, TD Bank Financial Group."
     What do "Master Codewright & JOAT-in-training" in the signatures
     mean?  Is this a kind of a degree in programming or what?  (This is
     probably obvious for readers in Canada and the US but it isn't for
     us abroad, in particularly in view of the fact that The Webster's
     Collegiate Dictionary contains the "shipwright" but not a
     "codewright".&nbsp;:-)) And what is "The Pitcher Digital Freehold" that
     you are using as the name of the "Organization"?&nbsp; :-)</em></p>
  <p><b>Lew Pitcher</b>:
   Yes, my various signatures and statuses can be a bit confusing. So,
   I'll try to organize this answer a bit for you.
  </p><p>
   I live in Canada, and work for one of the largest Canadian financial
   institutions we have. Over the years, I've had many jobs within
   Toronto Dominion Bank, varying from machine operator to systems
   programmer to application developer and more. My current job title is
   "IT Specialist", which just means that I know a lot about everything
   and am qualified to work on almost any aspect of an IT project. I've
   worked at Toronto Dominion Bank in the IT field for almost 30&nbsp;years,
   so I have the experience and training to back that job title up.
  </p><p>
   As you might guess, computers are my hobby as well as my occupation.
   One way or another, I have developed for or worked on computers for
   over 35&nbsp;years (starting in my teens, in school). And, as you can
   imagine, this history of computer use has left me knowledgable in
   almost every aspect of computer use. In my time, I've developed code
   for several types of mainframe, as well as minicomputers and
   microcomputers. I've installed, configured and administered Unix
   boxen and mainframe systems. I know databases, programming languages,
   operating systems, hardware, software, communications protocols, and
   a whole gamut of IT technologies that would take the whole interview
   to list. In other words, I've got the depth and breadth of experience
   of a lifetime of playing with every aspect of computers that I could.
  </p><p>
   "Codewright" is a term that (to my knowledge) I invented. A "wright"
   is a builder; a "wheelwright" builds wooden wheels, a "wainwright"
   builds carriages, and a "shipwright" builds ships; all exercise some
   specialized knowledge to build their particularly specialized
   constructions. In the construction industry, a "master" is one who
   has mastered the arts such that he is known as "the one who knows",
   so a "master wheelwright" would be the highest form of "wheelwright"
   you could find.
  </p><p>
   With my abilities for developing applications and over 30&nbsp;years of
   experience in that form of construction, I felt that "Master
   Codewright" might suitably express both my history and my abilities.&nbsp;:-) I am considered (by my peers) to be one who has conquered the
   highest arts of writing programs, and I tried to capture that in my
   'personal' signature.
  </p><p>
   "JOAT-in-training" reflects both my personal attitude towards my
   life, and the particular state of my career. You may have heard the
   phrase "Jack of all trades, master of none"? Well, my goal in life is
   to become a "Jack Of All Trades" when it comes to computers (I intend
   to retain my "Master Codewright" status, thus belying the second half
   of that phrase&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;). Since I'm not a "Jack Of All Trades"
   (J&nbsp;O&nbsp;A&nbsp;T)
   yet, I name myself a "JOAT-in-training".
  </p><p>
   Overall, I think you get to know me a bit better through my
   'personal' signature than the 'official' signature that I use when I
   post from work.
  </p><p>
   Finally, "The Pitcher Digital Freehold" is my informal name for my
   home LAN and the organization I put around it. I have tried to
   maintain my home LAN using the model that large organizations use to
   control their computing environments. I have change control and
   backups, users and services, etc. but all in a much smaller scale,
   and with less rigour than a commercial enterprise would. Since I have
   a LAN, and various tools required some identifier of the
   "Organization", I named my LAN "The Pitcher Digital Freehold". A
   "freehold" is a real-estate term that denotes a piece of land that
   (outside of the governmental legal obligations) is owned by an
   individual. My LAN is a piece of digital "real-estate", with similar
   obligations and rights as a real freehold, so I thought the name
   apropos.
  </p>

  <p><br><em>
  1. How did you get interested in computers and IT in general, and in
     Linux in particular?  If your memory is not so foggy as mine, do
     you remember the first time you got to touch a computer?  Which one
     was it?  Tell us about it.</em>
  </p><p>
   My interest in computers stems from high-school, about 35&nbsp;years ago.
   One of my courses introduced computers (in the form of a desk-sized
   'portable' that used mark-sense "bubble" cards for input) and I
   haven't looked back since. I've owned many computers in my time, from
   a Cromemco Z2 Z80 system (for which I wrote my own CP/M CBIOS)
   through to the 5 PCs I now have. I've used many operating systems,
   from CP/M to MSDOS to Minix to Microsoft Windows to OS/2 to Linux. As
   you know, my career is in computers as well, so I won't bore you with
   the extensive details. Suffice it to say, my job contributed to my
   interest as much as my interest contributed to my job.
  </p><p>
   As for Linux, my introduction was through Slackware (which we'll talk
   about next), as I finished up learning Minix&nbsp;[<a href="./person.html#one">1</a>].
   My college education
   has been on the practical side of computing, not the theoretical, so
   I took the opportunity to learn how Unixish operating systems work by
   learning on Minix. OS code development in Minix is easy; it is
   intended to be an educational OS, so efficiency is secondary, and
   code clarity and principles of operation come first. I had learned a
   lot from Minix (and contributed a BSDish init process&nbsp;[<a href="./person.html#two">2</a>] back to the
   Minix&nbsp;1.5 code tree), and I found a copy of "Slackware Linux&nbsp;3.0" at
   a local bookstore. That CD set got me started in Linux and in
   Slackware, and I've never looked back.</p>

<!-- -->
  <p><br><em>
  2. We are not going to ask you "Why Slackware?" because, again, the
     answer is given in your signature: "Slackware - Because I know what
     I'm doing."  Since you are an IT specialist, it's interesting to
     get to know though how did you come to choose Slackware among
     dozens and dozens of other Linux distributions?  Did you try other
     distros before Slackware or any other open source UNIX clones?</em>
  </p><p>
   As I said above, I found Slackware first, tried it, and liked it. My
   goals are twofold: first, to learn as much as I can about everything
   ("JOAT-in-training", remember&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;), and second to run a
   professional environment. Slackware gave me the opportunity to do
   both.
  </p><p>
   I've tried other distros since I started with Slackware, but nothing
   has come close to Slackware's simplicity and professionalism. I
   installed SuSE for a friend's software business, Ubuntu on my
   nephew's desktop machine, and Knoppix on another machine. I have used
   RedHat and SuSE at work. None of the other distros even come close to
   letting me, as the sysadmin of my systems, do exactly what I want
   with my systems. Slackware lets me put together a system in exactly
   the configuration I need to accomplish the job I must (or choose to)
   do. No muss, no fuss, nothing in the way "for my own good".
  </p><p>
   Using Slackware was easy for me. It looked (mostly) like the AT&amp;T
   System V Unix I sysadmined at work, but with some BSDish tools that I
   wished I had. It didn't look like a Mac or Windows "wannabe".</p>

<!-- -->
  <p><br><em>
  3. What is the way you are using Slackware?  Is it mostly a server for
     you or a desktop or both?  According to the <a href="./essence-1.html">Slack Essence-1</a>,
     devoted to configuring a firewall/router, you are having a whole
     LAN of PCs (at home?)  Is this a `mixed environment' or do you
     manage to perform all necessary tasks on Slackware Linux machines?</em></p>
  <p>
	I use Slackware everywhere.
  </p><p>
   At home, I have it exclusively on my Toshiba laptop, and as a
   dual-boot option on my desktop system. I also have it on my
   firewall/server that our two laptops and two desktops plug into. Yes,
   my home LAN has 5&nbsp;nodes (2 MSWindows, 1&nbsp;dual-boot
   Slackware/MSWindows, and 2 Slackware-exclusive) at the moment&nbsp;:-)
  </p><p>
   My day-to-day at-home system is Slackware Linux 10.1 (soon to be
   10.2), but I retain Microsoft Windows 98 for both my wife (she's not
   ready to try Linux yet) and for work. I telecommute to work often,
   and the VPN software that my employer uses does not work with Linux.
   Since I can't dictate my employers choice of software, I work within
   their requirements, and restrict myself to Win98 on those occasions.
   Otherwise, I would use Slackware exclusively. My "router/firewall"
   server also supports email (fetchmail and sendmail), web services (an
   intranet wiki, and an internet Drupal website), database services,
   distributed print services, and my intranet DNS and DHCP servers. My
   Slackware desktop and laptop are my primary home working environment,
   with GUI and multimedia support.
  </p><p>
   At work, I use Slackware as a server. It primarily hosts some tools
   that make development and quality tracking on our IBM host
   environment easier; a host "print-to-email" service&nbsp;[<a href="./person.html#three">3</a>], several
   production system quality tracking tools (written in Perl and PHP),
   and a web service to format host data for browser access. Our work
   environment consists of many different systems, including MSWindows,
   OS/2, SuSE Linux, AIX, OS400 and Z/OS, and my little Slackware box
   works with all of these systems.
  </p>

<!-- -->
  <p><br><em>
  4. Another question in connection with the previous one: there is an
     on-going debate on <a href="http://www.osnews.com">OSNews</a>
     and other OS-related news sites, whether
     Linux is ready for desktop or not.  In our opinion, this is similar
     to the question "Is a Formula-1 racing car ready for a casual
     driver?"  What is your opinion on the subject?</em></p>
  <p>
   I can't see what the debate is about. I've used Linux "on the desktop" for
   quite a while now, and so do a number of other people I know of. I don't
   really think that the debate is about whether or not Linux is "ready for the
   desktop"; I believe that the <em>real</em> debate is about whether or not Linux can
   be used by people who have absolutely no knowledge of computers. And that
   debate is one that even the current collection of "ready for the desktop"
   operating systems lose; there are no computer operating systems that make a
   computer as simple to use as a toaster or television. Heck, even the modern
   television isn't simple to use anymore&#8212;just ask my father-in-law (who's TV
   keeps turning itself on at 12:00 every day).
  </p><p>
   In general, computers (at least those machines that people think of
   when they talk about computers) are complex and complicated beasts.
   They are general purpose machines capable of "being" any number of
   complex tools at the same time. By their nature, they are not simple
   things and no interface (no matter how well advertised and sold) can
   simplify them down to the level that most commercial software claims
   to have.
  </p><p>
   Case in point: the benchmark (for better or worse) of "the desktop"
   is the Microsoft Windows platform. We all have our own opinions about
   the "ease of use" of <em>that</em> platform, but it is held as the
   standard to which Linux desktops must measure themselves against. I
   spent 6&nbsp;hours cleansing my mother-in-law's Windows system of two
   nasty pieces of spyware that mysteriously got on to her system.
   Windows did it's best to hide everything from me so that I <em>could
   not</em> remove the spyware&#8212;this is Windows job: to hide complexity
   away from the user so that the user <em>thinks</em> that the system
   is simple. Unfortunately, it also hid all the tools away as well, so
   as to prevent me from fixing the system. The good news is that I
   prevailed, and dug past the layers of "helpfullness" that Microsoft
   placed between me and the OS, and I did finally cleanse the system of
   it's spyware.
  </p><p>
   On the other hand, with Linux systems, I have all the tools readily
   available. They are simple tools that will not get in my way, but
   complex enough to fix the problem without too much effort on my part.
   Linux hasn't hidden the complexity away; it points out where "this is
   complex&#8212;please be carefull" and where "this is easy&#8212;go at it".
  </p><p>
   Is Linux ready for the desktop? Yes, it is, and has been for all of this
   century. Is Linux simple? No, but neither is anything else (despite the lies
   that the marketing people would tell you).</p>

<!-- -->
  <p><br><em>
  5. Another on-going discussion in the web relates to security.
     Designers of OpenBSD argue (a link) their system having a much more
     secure architecture and much more clean code than Linux.  Could you
     please comment on the subject?  (Has any of your Linux machines
     ever been cracked?)  To that end, what is your approach to
     security, as in securing your own boxes, production and
     development/testing alike?</em></p>
  <p>
   While I'm certain that the designers of OpenBSD/FreeBSD/NetBSD argue
   that *BSD is more secure and 'cleaner' than Linux, I'll stick with
   Linux for now. To me, it is a pragmatic decision: Linux is secure
   enough and clean enough that I haven't had problems with it, and is
   supported in more environments and on and by more hardware than any
   of the *BSDs. The telling point is that the *BSDs have been around
   longer than Linux, but have not made nearly the same impact that
   Linux has. If they are so good, why is Linux the leader?
  </p><p>
   My own systems I secure as well as I can. I have some exposures to be
   certain, but I keep an eye on them and keep the systems up to date.
   As I write this, six slackware-security notices have arrived at my
   in-basket, and by the time you get this, the patches will be
   installed on all of my systems. As I mentioned before, I try to run
   my infrastructure in a professional manner. This takes a bit more
   effort than the casual user might want, but to me the effort is worth
   it.</p>

<!-- -->
  <p><br><em>
  6. What are your favourite programs not included in the Slackware
     distribution?  Anything you especially prefer as `root'?</em></p>
  <p>
	That's a tough question, partially because I don't use many programs outside
	of the standard Slackware distro, and partly because of the variety of
	programs that I do use.
  </p><p>
	How's this:
  </p><ul>
   <li>Game: <a href="http://icculus.org/neverball/">Neverball</a></li>
   <li>Office Tool: <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a></li>
   <li>CMS: <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a></li>
   <li>Wiki: <a href="http://www.lars-ackermann.de/wiki/static/StartPage.html">PWP Wiki</a></li>
   <li>Internet: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox and Thunderbird</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
	As root, I have all the tools I need with the native Slackware install.
   <em>But</em>,
	I use <a href="http://anacron.sourceforge.net/">anacron</a> to handle the startup 'cron'
	tasks on my laptop and desktop.</p>


<!-- -->
  <p><br><em>
  7. A personal question from Ayaz: A Windows user enquires, "Why should
     I use Linux?  And specifically Slackware?"  How would you tackle
     this question and how satisfactorily will you answer it so as to
     persuade <b>her</b> to some extent to actually consider using Linux, not
     necessarily Slackware?</em></p>
  <p>
   Remember back around 1995, when Bill Gates said "If you don't know
   what you need Windows NT for, you don't need it"? (FWIW, there's some
   irony here&#8212;Windows XP is an enhanced NT, and most people <em>still</em>
   don't know why they need NT.) Despite my own preferences for Linux,
   my answer is similar to Bill's: If you don't know what you need Linux
   for, you don't need Linux.</p>
  <p>
	To my defense, most Windows users regularly see why they need Linux, from the
	deficiencies and difficulties they have with Windows.</p>
  <p>
	To our hypothetical Windows user, I would have to say</p>
  <ul>
  <li>If you want a stable system that doesn't "slow down with age", use Linux.</li>

  <li>If you want a cheap system that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to maintain,
  use Linux.</li>

  <li>If you want a secure system that doesn't leak personal information or permit
  others to take over your computer, use Linux.</li>

  <li>If you want a portable system, that runs on anything, anywhere, use Linux.</li>

  <li>On the other hand, if you want to keep paying a billionare for
  software that doesn't work, is full of bugs and security holes, and is
  sold primarily to make him richer, use Windows. Just don't expect me
  to fix it for you when you need those virusus, spyware and adware
  programs cleaned off, or your OS reinstalled because everything keeps
  crashing, or to pay for the upgrade to Office for you. I won't.</li></ul>
  <p>
	And then, I'd hand her a live CD and show her what Linux can do.</p>

  <p><br><em>
  8. [I am going to let loose an old horse and beat it again with a
     stick] but in my experience with persuading people to move over to
     Slackware from RedHat and similar distributions, I have often
     always found myself stumped defending the argument that
     "Slackware's installer is really simple".  How would you handle the
     situation if you were to explain to someone that Slackware's
     installer is really simple?</em></p>
  <p>
   I guess that there are two situations implicit in this question.
   First, there's the situation where you are installing Slackware fresh
   on a machine, wiping it clean of anything previously resident on the
   system. The other situation is where you are upgrading an existing
   Slackware system, without impacting the stable, running setup.
  </p><p>
   I've never liked the overly-friendly "let me do it for you" installs
   of most of the other distributions. Too often, these sorts of
   installs make assumptions about what I want that are contrary to my
   wishes, and I'm stuck with having to undo the bad decisions of a
   program that had no business making the decision in the first place.
   That Slackware's install is done from the commandline and not from a
   GUI is inconsequential; the GUI is often harder to manipulate than
   the commandline, and it fails when used with unusual hardware ("I
   have no mouse and I must click"). The slackware install is both
   friendly and unassuming. Although it gives the user options to
   "install everything", it also gives the user the power to say "but
   not that one". It works on every system I've tried it on, where some
   GUI installers can't even get the display properties right and quit
   before they offer the first window.
  </p><p>
   My home server is in my basement and my den is on the second floor of
   my house. My workplace is about 20&nbsp;km away from my home, and my
   Slackware server there is on a different floor from my desk. No
   matter where I am, I can upgrade Slackware software with a single ssh
   command. No GUI necessary, and I don't have to be in front of the
   machine to do it. Slackware's simple commandline tools work no matter
   what the circumstances. For what it's worth, although I keep my work
   server up-to-date, I haven't actually seen the system in about a
   year. All my administration is done through ssh using commandline
   tools. If I were running any other distro, I would have to sit in
   front of the machine and interact with the GUI in order to do simple
   administration tasks that I can do remotely without a GUI with
   Slackware.
  </p><p>
   Yes, Slackware install and upgrade scripts are simple to use. Yes,
   they work without the overhead that GUI tools require. And, yes, they
   can be used with a GUI. You can't say that about many of the other
   package management tools around.</p>

  <p><br><em>
  9. Is there any LUG at the place you live?  If yes, are you an active
     member of it?  Which distribution do most of the members use?</em></p>
  <p>
   I live in Brampton, Ontario, which is a suburb of Toronto. This is
   both a good thing and a bad thing; good because Toronto has a wide
   variety of services, including several Linux user groups and stores
   that cater to Linux users, bad because Brampton is just far enough
   away from Toronto to make it inconvenient to visit casually. There
   used to be a LUG in Brampton, but it disappeared well before I ever
   knew it existed.
  </p><p>

   But, I am not LUGless. I belong to a "virtual Linux User Group" run
   by a friend of mine. Marcel Gagne&nbsp;[<a href="./person.html#four">4</a>]
   (author of the LJ "Cooking with
   Linux" column and books like "Moving to Linux&#8212;Kiss the Blue Screen
   of Death Goodbye") runs an email/web Linux User Group called the
   WFTL-LUG&nbsp;[<a href="./person.html#five">5</a>].
   There are a dozen or so regulars, including myself, but
   the group apparently spans hundreds of people in dozens of countries
   all over the world. From newbie to guru, all are welcome to the
   group; physical attendance is (of course) optional&nbsp;:-)
  </p><p>
   Since the LUG is such a widespread collection of people, there
   doesn't seem to be a distribution-of-choice. We have several
   Slackware users, but Debian, Knoppix, Ubuntu, Red Hat/Fedora, and
   SuSE users also abound. Surprisingly (or not), discussions rarely
   centre around which distro is better. More often, we discuss the "how
   to" of Linux use. It is a wonderful group, and Marcel is a great
   host. We've even (inadvertently) contributed to Marcel's articles and
   books&nbsp;:-)

   rural Ontario. I have a huge collection of Science Fiction (one wall
   in my den, and one in another room) which I read all the time.
   Recently, I was reminded of a passage from one of my favourite SF
   authors that sums up my attitude pretty well...</p>

  <blockquote><p>
   A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher
   a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts,
   build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders,
   cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch
   manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die
   gallantly. Specialization is for insects. (Robert Anson Heinlein&nbsp;-
   "Time Enough for Love")</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
	These are my hobbies, more or less.</p>

  <p><br><em>
  11. Lew, could you please share your favourite one-liner or two with
      us?</em></p>
  <p>
	Put me on the spot, why don't you&nbsp;:-)</p>
  <p>
	How about these...</p>

  <blockquote><p>
   When the going gets tough, the tough get Slackware.  &lt;grin&gt;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
	or, as I said in one WFTL-LUG chat</p>

  <blockquote><p>
   I've got a wit. Not quite a full wit, but better than a half-wit, to be
   sure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   or, finally, I'm playing with using DVD+RW disks to back up my systems, so my
   last one liner is</p>

  <pre class="listing">
  tar -cj /etc /var /home /usr | growisofs -Z /dev/scd0=/dev/fd/0</pre>
