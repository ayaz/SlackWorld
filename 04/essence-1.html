  <h2>
   Slack Essence-1<a href="./essence-1.html#essence">*</a>:
   How do I construct a firewall for my dial-out or PPPoE environment?
  </h2>

  <p>
   <b>Author:</b> Lew Pitcher
  </p>

  <p>
   I want a strong firewall which protects my PPP/PPPoE established IP
   address while not interfering with traffic over my LAN. The firewall is
   implemented on my router/gateway/NAT machine, which also provides
   number of IP-enabled services for my LAN, and a <em>couple</em> of IP-enabled
   services for the internet.
  </p>

  <h3>A Strong, Permanent Firewall</h3>
  <p>
   The first step is to establish a basic set of firewall rules that will
   apply even if the system has no external connection. I create a script 
   called <tt class="verb">/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall</tt>
   which contains some generic firewalling
   rules that prevent any access between the outside and my LAN. These
   rules are activated on startup by the following script segment in
   <tt class="verb">/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2</tt>
  </p>

  <pre class="listing">
    # If there is a firewall script, run it before enabling packet forwarding.
    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall ]; then
     /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall start
    fi</pre>

  <p>
   The <a href="./files/rc.firewall"><tt class="verb">rc.firewall</tt></a> rules are aimed to protect my router from unauthorized access, 
   even if there were no other rules in place. These "default" rules disallow 
   any packets from anywhere or to anywhere if they do not come from either my 
   LAN (via eth0) or the loopback (via lo). This makes it more difficult for 
   someone to add an unauthorized interface (say, a VPN interface as tun0) and 
   get packets in or out of the default configuration. The default is to deny 
   everything that isn't explicitly permitted.
  </p><p>
   Basically, it performs the following actions when started:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>it resets the built-in <b>iptables</b>' chains
      and defines the default policies ("DENY" for INPUT and FORWARD chains
      and "ACCEPT" for OUTPUT chain),</li>
    <li>permits incoming traffic via loopback and the interior interface
      (eth0),</li>
    <li>creates two chains (log_and_drop and log_and_deny) that will be envoked
      in another script called ip-up.firewall.</li>
   </ol>

  <p>
   Before performing the three actions, <a href="./files/rc.firewall"><tt class="verb">rc.firewall</tt></a>
   loads all
   iptables-related modules that may be needed.  Actually, one doesn't have
   to load all of them explicitly when running a kernel compiled with
   <tt class="verb">CONFIG_KMOD=y</tt> (as, for example, is done for the stock Slackware kernel)
   but this is an attempt at a "bulletproof" ruleset, and should they be
   run on a system with a self-compiled kernel (which I usually do). I
   prefer to leave them in unnecessarily rather than risk an  exposure by
   removing them when they should be there.  The same is true for a number
   of "<b>rmmod</b>" commands envoked when the firewall is stopped.
  </p>

  <h3>Poking Holes in the Firewall</h3>
  <p>
   In <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt>, I add this line:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
    /etc/ppp/ip-up.firewall "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4" "$5" "$6"</pre>
  <p>
   Here,
  </p>
  <dl>
        <dt></dt> 
        <dd><tt class="verb">$1</tt> is the name of the interface over which the PPP connection has been
        established. This will be 'ppp0' for the ppp0 device, 'ppp1' for the
        ppp1 device, etc. If you run multiple PPP or PPP0E connections, each
        connection will be given its own IP address and its own device name.</dd>

        <dt><br></dt> 
        <dd><tt class="verb">$2</tt> is the name of the serial device on which the PPP connection was made.
        For true serial connections this will be something like <tt class="verb">/dev/ttyS0</tt>.</dd>

        <dt><br></dt>
        <dd><tt class="verb">$3</tt> is the serial linespeed of the PPP link. For dial-up connections, this is
        the speed at which the modem converses with the CPU. For PPPoE, this is
        an empty parameter, and can be ignored.</dd>

        <dt><br></dt> 
        <dd><tt class="verb">$4</tt> is the IP address assigned to the local side (our side) of the PPP
        connection. This is our IP address on the PPP link.</dd>

        <dt><br></dt> 
        <dd><tt class="verb">$5</tt> is the IP address assigned to the remote side (the ISP side) of the PPP
        connection. I don't use this value in these firewall scripts, but may at
        some future time add rules to permit or deny access to packets
        originating specifically at my ISP's site, in which case, this address
        will come in handy.</dd>

        <dt><br></dt> 
        <dd><tt class="verb">$6</tt> is the text string given to the <b>pppd</b>
        daemon by the ipparm parameter of
        <b>pppd</b>. It can be used to name a config file, or to provide a set of
        additional, site specific, parameters to the ppp scripts.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
   When <b>pppd</b> establishes an IP session with my ISP, it invokes
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt>, giving it the interface name as
   parameter <tt class="verb">$1</tt> and the assigned IP address as
   parameter <tt class="verb">$4</tt>. The additional lines in <tt
   class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up</tt> will invoke my firewall-building
   script, giving it the device name that's been started, and the IP
   address assigned to that device.
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/</tt><a href="./files/ip-up.firewall"><tt class="verb">ip-up.firewall</tt></a>
   establishes
   the specific firewalling rules for the device and IP address that ppp
   has connected to the Internet with.
  </p>

  <p>
   The chains built by <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/</tt><a href="./files/ip-up.firewall"><tt class="verb">ip-up.firewall</tt></a>
   are all named so as to
   relate to the interface that they apply to. This way, the script can
   independently manage more than one ppp device (i.e. ppp0 <em>and</em> ppp1),
   with rules that do not conflict. The rule chains built are named
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> $1.in (i.e., <em>ppp0.in</em> or <em>ppp1.in</em>)
   for rules to be applied against
   packets received by the named interface, for the interface's IP
   address [<a href="./essence-1.html#one">1</a>],</li>
   <li>
   $1.out (i.e., <em>ppp0.out</em> or <em>ppp1.out</em>) for rules to be applied
   against packets sent to the named interface, from the interface's IP
   address, and</li>
   <li>
   $1.fwd (i.e., <em>ppp0.fwd</em> or <em>ppp1.fwd</em>) for rules to be applied
   against packets received by the named interface for IP addresses other
   than the interface's IP address (packets to be forwarded).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Plugging the holes in the Firewall</h3>
  <p>
   In <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt> I add:
  </p>
  <pre class="listing">
    /etc/ppp/ip-down.firewall "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4" "$5" "$6"</pre>
  <p>
   When <b>pppd</b> terminates the IP session, it invokes
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt>, giving
   it the interface name as parameter <tt class="verb">$1</tt>.
   The additional lines in
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-down</tt>
   will invoke my firewall-tightening script, giving it
   the device name that's been stopped and the IP address assigned to
   that device.
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/</tt><a href="./files/ip-down.firewall"><tt class="verb">ip-down.firewall</tt></a>
   removes the specific
   firewalling rules for the device and IP address that
   <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/</tt><a href="./files/ip-up.firewall"><tt class="verb">ip-up.firewall</tt></a>
   installed when ppp connected to the Internet on it.
  </p>

  <h3>IP Tables flow diagram</h3>
  <p>
   The diagram below shows the flow of packets through the various
   IP Tables evaluation stages.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The <tt class="verb">$1.in</tt>
    rules in <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up.firewall</tt>
    are applied in the "INPUT" stage of the flow.</li>
   <li>
    The <tt class="verb">$1.out</tt> rules in
    <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up.firewall</tt> are applied in the
    "OUTPUT" stage of the flow.</li>
   <li>
    The <tt class="verb">$1.fwd</tt> rules in
    <tt class="verb">/etc/ppp/ip-up.firewall</tt> are applied in the
    "FORWARD" stage of the flow.</li>
  </ul>

 </p>

  <p>
   About the diagram:
  </p><p>
   Scenario A represents the flow of packets from an outside source through
   a local interface (via the IP address assigned to that interface) to
   an application on the local system. These packets have the local IP
   address of the receiving interface as their target address. For
   example, these could be 'ping request' packets coming from the internet
   targetted at the system's public IP address.
  </p><p>
   Scenario B represents the flow of packets from the an application on the
   local system through a local interface (via the IP address assigned to
   that interface) to an outside destination. These packets have a target
   IP address that the system can access by way of a route through the
   selected interface, and packets will have the IP address of that
   interface as their source address. For example, these could be 'ping
   response' packets coming from the system's public IP address targetted
   at the internet.
  </p><p>
   Scenario C represents the flow of packets from the an application on the
   local system through a local interface (via the IP address assigned to
   that interface) to another local application. These packets have the
   local IP address of the sending interface as their source address, and
   will have the IP address of that same interface as their target
   address. For example, this could represent the traffic flow between two
   local applications that use TCP/IP as an interprocess communications
   medium.
  </p><p>
   Scenario D represents the complex flow of packets from an application on
   the local system through a local interface (via the IP address assigned
   to that interface) to an application on a foreign system. These packets
   have a target IP address that the system can access by way of a route
   through the selected interface, and packets will have the IP address of
   the first local interface as their source address. For example, this
   could represent the traffic flow from a local application bound to one
   IP address and a target that's routed through a different interface
   than the one bound to by the application.
  </p><p>
   Scenario E represents the flow of packets from an outside source through
   a local interface, into the "routing" logic, and out through another
   local interface to an application on another system. These packets do
   not have a local IP address as their target address, but instead have
   the IP address for a system that the firewall routes for. For example,
   this would be the flow of packets through the firewall system for a NAT
   conversation between an intranet system and an internet system.
  </p><p>
   Scenarios C and D rarely occur in "real life" use. Both of these
   scenarios postulate that a local application has opened a socket on a
   specific IP address (say, the local IP address of the PPP connection),
   and that application then directs packets to a target reachable through
   that or another local interface (say, through lo or the LAN interface).
   There are very few apps that default to such a binding, and these
   scenarios are included mostly for completeness sake. The diagram is part
   of my "working notes" from when I built my firewall scripts. I used this
   diagram to dry run the firewall rules by checking if and how the rules
   covered packets traveling through each of these scenarios. Local packets
   (for instance) should flow without restriction through the filters in
   scenario&nbsp;C and&nbsp;D, but should be filtered for unroutable addresses
   and other conditions in scenarios&nbsp;A, B, or&nbsp;E.
   Since the filter rules are not
   associated to a particular packet flow scenario, but to a specific point
   in the packet processing, some rules may have unwanted side effects
   because they process not only 'suspect' packets, but 'good' packets as
   well.
  </p><p>
   Overall, the ruleset that I wrote was intended to be both as
   "bulletproof" as I could make it, and to accommodate additional
   interfaces with little or no modification.  I have to say that it works
   as I intended it; I have used these scripts for about 5&nbsp;years now,
   without any problems or network invasions.

  <p>
   [<a id="one">1</a>] Assume, for the moment, that I have two PPP connections active.
   ppp0 and ppp1 will each have different IP  addresses, and will be
   activated and deactivated independently. I didn't want the
   <tt class="verb">ip-down.firewall</tt> rule for ppp0 (say) to deactivate the rules in place
   for ppp1, and vice versa. So I name my chains according to the
   interface they act on and belong to.
