 <h2>Eric Hameleers: Slackware does exactly what I want it to do.<br>
 13.1 questions to AlienBOB on the occasion of Slackware 13.1 release (with answers :-)
 </h2>

 <p>
  Published: June 11, 2010
 </p>

<p>Dear fellow Slackers! We are happy to publish an interview with
another Slackware developer, <a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/about/">Eric Hameleers</a>,
he has kindly given us on the occasion of the Slackware-13.1 release. Enjoy!
</p>

<p><em>
Dear Eric:<br>
Many congratulations on the release of Slackware 13.1, and thank you for
the hard-work and time you have spent to making it all possible. This time
around, in light of the release of Slackware 13.1, we have prepared a
list of "13.1" questions that we would be happy to ask you.
These are essentially the same questions (but .1 :-) that we have already
<a href="./robby-workman-on-slackware-13.1.html">asked Robby&nbsp;Workman</a>
and we are interested in another look on the same subject.
</em></p>

<p><em>
1. One can read in README.TXT and PACKAGES.TXT which programs are
included in any release of Slackware. We believe words like gcc-4.4.4
do not say much if anything for a mere mortal Slacker though. Thus,
our first question is: what do you think are the most remarkable
features of Slackware-13.1 and what do they bring to a "home Slacker"
and to a guru of the visible Slackverse?  
</em></p>
<p>
Looking back at the the months before the release of Slackware 13.1, I
would say that we wanted to improve 13.0 in a number of aspects and make
13.1 a fairly short development cycle&mdash;make it a "bug fix release" as it
were. Obviously things went a bit different. There are several exciting
updates in Slackware 13.1 which could have justified a 14.0 release
instead of the 13.1 point release. A big and visible change is of course
the update to KDE Software Compilation 4.4.3 which uses ConsoleKit and
PolicyKit. The combination with a very recent kernel and X.Org allow many
people to have a pleasant out-of-the-box experience with modern hardware.
When you look at the <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/slackware-13-1-first-impressions-810094/">testimonials
in the Slackware forum of LinuxQuestions.org</a>, you find that Slackware
 13.1 feels a lot faster than
13.0 on bootup, uses less hardware resources (KDE 4.2 was a resource hog)
and KDE 4.4.3 is as least as good, if not better than, the KDE 3.5.10
that came with Slackware 12.2. Our new KDE is speedy, has beautiful
graphics, and enhances your productivity.
</p>
<p><em>
2. There were an incredible number of updates since release 13.0: the
kernel evolved from version 2.6.29.6 to 2.6.33.4, gcc changed from
4.3.3 to 4.4.4, gtk+2 updated from version 2.14.7 to 2.18.9, the
X.org system passed through a huge update, there were multiple
updates in KDE and other applications and libraries.  A number of new
packages were added. With all these immense updates of the
distribution since release 13.0, what was the most difficult part of
preparing Slack-13.1 personally for you?  
</em></p>
<p>
I think the previous development cycle (leading to the 13.0 release) was
a lot harder for me, since I had to create Slackware64 from scratch and
keep it in sync with Patrick Volkerding's process on the 32-bit side. I
have a day job, and Pat's build computers are a lot faster than mine, so
it was exhausting at times to keep up with his pace. Working toward 13.1
felt more relaxed, the hardest part being my own personal goal of getting
KDE 4.4 included. It took some persuasion, but what helped a lot were the
reports from people running my KDE 4.4 packages (including some of the
Slackware team) documenting that 4.4.x was so much better than
Slackware's KDE 4.3. Having PolicyKit as a requirement for KDE 4.4 was
the big hurdle actually, because PolicyKit did not support Slackware's
shadow authentication backend, only PAM was supported. And since PAM is
still off-limits in Slackware, there was a joint effort by several of the
Slackware team plus Andrew Psaltis from the WICD team to get Slackware
supported in PolicyKit.
</p>
<p><em>
3. Can you tell us about your personal duties/impact in the development
of Slackware-13.1
</em></p>
<p>
There are no real "duties" of course. The cycle of package updates is
quite a natural process. Everyone in the team has a special interest in
parts of the distro but there is a lot of synergy.
</p><p>
Things I care about most are the initial impressions of the Slackware
user. Once lost, never regained. So, I do a lot of test-installations. I
keep working on the Slackware installer, together with Stuart&nbsp;Winter (who
uses the identical installer in <a href="http://www.armedslack.org/">ARMedslack</a>),
and on the <b>mkinitrd</b> package,
where a lot of under-the-hood enhancements went in.
</p><p>
I have been tracking the KDE 4.4 development of course, using
<a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/">my blog</a>
for the announcements and using feedback to tune the builds. All of this "out
of tree" testing finally led to inclusion of the KDE Software Compilation
4.4.3 into Slackware, something I am very happy with because it is such
an improvement over 4.3. I grew fond of KDE4 when I was building
slackware64&mdash;at that time, Slackware still used KDE3 while KDE 4.1 was
available in the testing area. I decided against building KDE3 for
64-bit, anticipating that KDE4 would have matured sufficiently by the
time&mdash;if ever&mdash;Slackware64 would go public (something which was not at
all certain at that time). And I think that with KDE 4.4.3 we have
finally reached a level of stability and useability that equals the old
KDE 3.5.10. It looks much better too. Behind all the eye candy is a
tightly integrated desktop environment which gives me a lot more power
than KDE3 ever did. Many of the complaints about KDE4 are adjustment
problems, it takes a while to develop a mind set that fits with KDE4
after you switch from KDE3. But it will pay off if you invest in
discovering the many new features.
</p>
<p><em>
4. Is there anything you had meant to implement in Slack-13.1 but had to
postpone for the future? If yes, what was that and why was it postponed?
</em></p>
<p>
There are a number of items on my TODO list that I simply did not have
the time to implement or "defend". <a href="http://piterpunk.unitednerds.org/">PiterPUNK</a>
and I have written an
updated <b>liloconfig</b> even before 13.0 was released, which automates the
process of creating an <b>initrd.gz</b> to be used with the generic kernel. As
you may know, the huge kernel is primarily used for installation of
Slackware but our recommendation is to switch to the combination of
generic kernel plus initrd as soon as possible. This switch-over is still
not a trivial procedure, although I have tried to document it as well as
I could in the README_LVM.TXT. The new <b>liloconfig</b> was vetoed because it
was written too close to the 13.0 release. After 13.0 was released, I
have just been too busy with my KDE and VLC builds and further develpment
on liloconfig was pushed to the background. This is really something I
want to pick up in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I want to do, not necessarily for inclusion into Slackware
itself, is to investigate into the possibility to write a script that
takes a Slackware DVD ISO (or a package tree) and create a live DVD image
out of that, for promotion purposes.
The <a href="http://www.linux-live.org/">linux-live scripts</a>
are nice, but
too complex for my needs, plus it requires that you already have a
running system. Having a script that I can throw at a development tree
and gives me back a live DVD would be very nice to have. And finally, I
have ideas for a modified <b>initrd.gz</b> (this is the file on the Slackware
boot disk that contains the installer) which lets you start a PXE server
running right off the installation DVD. That would make it easy to
install Slackware over a network on other computers that lack a DVD
drive. I may have some time for all that, hopefully in the next few
months. From a historical perspective there is always a short period of
relative inactivity in Slackware's development right after a release&nbsp;&#8230;
room for some hobbying.
</p>
<p><em>
5. What sort of hardware do you have there running under the hood? The
"-j7" flag in many of the SlackBuild scripts hints of the use of a fast
machine. It would be very interesting to know what kind of hardware you
guys use. Do you employ multi-boot machines?
</em></p>
<p>
I have nothing fancy really&nbsp;&#8230; the parallellization flag in the
SlackBuilds is mainly beneficial to Patrick's build cluster. I have
compiled all my packages (including Slackware64 up to the moment that it
went public) on a home-built computer with single-core AMD Athlon64 3200+
and 2GB of internal RAM. That computer is ageing and has squeaking fans
but it does the job, and I can leave it running upstairs with the door
closed while I work in the living room&nbsp;&#8230; It is multi-boot naturally. At
the moment, it has six different OS-es installed on it, five of which are
Slackware 13.X and -current. I have virtual images of older releases
which I can access using QEMU.
</p><p>
It's not the only computer I own of course. But it is the fastest one. I
have an IBM T43 laptop and an Asus eeepc 1000H which I use a lot, and my
employer's Lenovo T400 is a dual-boot system with Windows and
Slackware64-current.
</p><p>
The team members have a varied collection of hardware, which is good
because there is a lot of software that we have to test under different
conditions. Think of programs and scripts to use bluetooth, wireless and
graphics drivers!
</p>
<p><em>
6. Is there anything in Slack you would like to change significantly? If
yes, what is this and why do you want this?
</em></p>
<p>
This is an easy question with a short answer: Slackware does exactly what
I want it to do. The contributions I have made which are mentioned in the
ChangeLog (not everything is mentioned there) are mostly related to
useability (expanding networking capabilites, enhancing the functionality
of Slackware's installer and boot scripts, things like that). Before I
became part of the team, I used to apply these customizations to my own
computer, but as a member of the Slackware team, I was able to add all of
that to the distro itself. It has come to a point where I am very pleased
with the distro as it is, and more effort can go in maintaining the
packages in <a href="http://connie.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/">my own repository</a>,
writing <a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/">blog</a> and
<a href="http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php">wiki articles</a>. You know,
all the things around Slackware that make it such a nice ecosystem.
</p><p>
There, I thought the answer would be simple, but I still managed to make
it long.
</p>
<p><em>
7. Do you ever try any distributions based on Slackware, e.g., Zenwalk or
Salix? Do you like any of the ideas implemented there (for example,
automated package management)?
</em></p>
<p>
I keep an eye on the forum messages and ChangeLogs of several of the
distros that are derived from Slackware. I have never installed and tried
any of them. Of all the spin-offs there are really only two that I like
enough to care about. Those are <a href="http://www.slax.org/">SLAX</a>&mdash;because
it is not really
Slackware, but an original product based on the linux-live scripts and
using Slackware; and <a href="http://www.kongoni.co.za/">Kongoni Linux</a>,
which prides itself that it only
includes software under a license approved by the Free Software
Foundation while remaining compatible with Slackware. It also uses a
ports package build system derived from BSD's.
</p><p>
Slackware itself has a good package manager of course. I believe that it
is a strength of Slackware that the administrator is responsible for
managing the software on his computer. It increases your awareness of how
the packages interact and does not give you a false sense of security.
The <b>slapt-get</b> and <b>netpkg</b> and whatever else are nice tools for these
distros that allow them to stand out. After all, if they kept looking too
much like Slackware, what would be the point of ever using them?
</p>
<p><em>
8. In reviews that appear after any new release of Slackware, one can
often find complaints about missing dependency hell in the existing
system of package management in Slack.  Just of curiosity, have you ever
discussed a possibility of implementing an optional check of package
dependencies? With a tool like <b>depfinder</b>, this doesn't seem very
difficult to implement.
</em></p>
<p>
Automated dependency management&mdash;is something that will not be added to
Slackware under my watch :-) If this topic comes up in discussions at
all, it is not to see if Slackware should add it, but rather to dismiss
yet another email asking for dependency checking.
</p><p>
Dependency information is not part of the Slackware package
specification, and will not be added either. Not having this capability
allows us to have a very lean package management tool which can be
written in shell script. You would have a hard time finding a
Slackware-specific tool that needs compilation.
</p>
<p><em>
9. Do you personally use Slackware on laptops? Do you think Slackware is
suited well for running on laptops? The major issues we are aware of seem
to revolve around WiFi and resume/suspend/hibernate support. How well do
you think Slackware fares with regards to these and other overall
challenges that any Linux distribution faces when run on a laptop?
</em></p>
<p>
The first laptop which I installed Slackware on did not even have
wireless! When I joined IBM in 1997 I was given a laptop to do my work,
and one of the first things I did with it was to insert a Slackware CD.
Using Slackware on laptops has been a strong motivator to enhance
Slackware's network scripts with wireless support. The old PCMCIA
subsystem in Linux had wireless support already, but that only supports
obsolete 16-bit network cards. The market moved to 32-bit PC-card which
is basically a PCI interface, and I had to buy such a card in order to
test my new rc.wireless script. Nowadays, the <b>WICD</b> application in
Slackware's <tt>/extra</tt> directory makes life of the mobile Slacker a lot
easier, but there are still things it cannot do like supporting more than
two network interfaces. Still, I think that Slackware is very
well-equipped for use on laptops. The kernel of Slackware 13.1 supports a
lot of wireless cards, we added a graphical bluetooth manager, and
suspend/hibernate support requires almost no configuration these days.
KDE has a "netbook" workspace interface which has been optimized for
small screens. I get more hours out of a laptop's battery charge in
Slackware than in MS Windows.
</p>
<p><em>
10. The Slackware Package Browser, hosted at packages.slackware.it, is
going through an overhaul for a while now. Are there any updates on the
progress? When do you think it will be available for the public to use?
</em></p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the guy responsible for the Slackware web site and the
package browser as well&mdash;fizban&mdash;has a lot going on, so the progress on
the new package browser has stalled. <a href="http://twitter.com/slackwarelinux">His
twitter page</a> where he was documenting his efforts
has not seen a lot of activity recently. People in need of a package
browser can use this one instead: <a href="http://slackfind.net/en/">http://slackfind.net/en/</a>
created by Anton&nbsp;Kolechkin.
</p>
<p><em>
11. Why do you think relics like <b>amp</b> and <b>xv</b> are still kept in Slack? Is
there a text editor you would like to see included in Slack?
</em></p>
<p>
I think Slackware is slow to let go of old software. Especially if it
still works. The <b>xv</b> program is the only piece of "shareware" in
Slackware, and there are better alternatives nowadays, but Pat&nbsp;Volkerding
knows the author personally so that may well be a reason to keep it. I
don't touch a lot of software in Slackware, and I had my share of
surprises when I had to build every individual package for our new x86_64
platform. Lots of obscure but cool stuff in there!
</p><p>
Funny that you ask about an editor I want to see included. I'll let you
in on a little secret&nbsp;&#8230; I never had the need to add an editor, instead
there is one that I never even install. And that's <b>Emacs</b>. I am a <b>vi</b> user
to the core. Usually <b>elvis</b>, sometimes <b>vim</b> and I use <b>gvim</b> when I need an
editor in X Window (and even in MS Windows!).
</p>
<p><em>
12. What do you think about the way Linux in general is evolving? Is
there anything you miss or are not satisfied with?
</em></p>
<p>
I think the biggest issue I have is not with Linux (the kernel) but with
GNU/Linux (the operating system). The kernel keeps growing and getting
fatter but still manages to get better and faster, with expanding
hardware support. On the other hand, distro development is largely
dictated by what the "big guys", Redhat, Novell and Ubuntu see as
"improvements". It is getting more and more obvious that the smaller
distros like our own Slackware are going to suffer. The decisions that
are being made with regards to software requirements and development
goals are made so that the big ones profit (for they are the ones who
spend big money on code development). You surely remember the year-long
fiasco with releases of <b>X.Org</b>, <b>mesa</b> and the Intel graphics driver that
did not play well together, resulting in a lot of disappointed Linux
users. And still, today, the state of X Window is in such flux that it is
very hard to assemble a coherent set of software that will make everybody
happy. It's true for Slackware as much as any other distro. And look at
how we were forced to adopt PolicyKit/ConsoleKit just to ship a
non-crippled KDE desktop; we had to apply a non-sanctioned patch to
PolicyKit so that it would work with Slackware. The continuous push
coming especially from Redhat to get their software accepted before they
reach maturity (like polkit, and upower, udisks and more to come) is very
much worrying me. Look at <b>polkit</b>&mdash;it evolved in several incompatible
steps but still has to reach a level of maturity, and it is becoming a
core component in every distro's authentication stack. It is amazing that
Pat&nbsp;Volkerding manages to release stable versions of Slackware despite
all this.
</p>
<p><em>
Out of order: question 13.1. Eric, personal question to you: why "Alien BOB"? :-)
</em></p>
<p>
Meh. I have been using the "alien" nick long before there was Internet. I
never experienced name clashes until I created my own repository on
slackware.com and (as a return favour) I decided to show myself in
Slackware forums and IRC channels to help other people. But there were
lots of aliens out there! In order to register an unique nick, I had to
make a fast decision. I looked at my screen, and saw my command prompt
"alien@bob$"&nbsp;&#8230; et voila!
</p>
<p><em>
13. And, in the end, is there anything you'd like to tell Slackers
about that we didn't dare ask?
</em></p>
<p>
People tell me how much they appreciate the nicely commented scripts, and
all the documentation on Slackware I have available in several places.
But you know, writing all that stuff down is a life-saver for me. I am
very forgetful&mdash;and by writing down very precisely how I work, I do not
have to keep re-inventing everything. 
My <a href="http://connie.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/">SlackBuild repository</a>
was born out of frustration. I used to compile all my stuff manually, and every 
time I needed to upgrade my system, I would have forgotten completely how
I had added all the extra software. I hated that so much that I decided
to keep journals, start writing build scripts and make my work public (so
that I would not lose it in case of a hard disk crash).
</p><p>
I also want to add that&mdash;even though Slackware no longer ships with
Gnome&mdash;there is a 3rd-party Gnome add-on that can be installed on top of
Slackware 13.1 with very little disturbance. 
The <a href="http://gnomeslackbuild.org/">GnomeSlackBuild</a> (or GSB)
project even has two releases available at
this moment: Gnome 2.28 which does not replace any original Slackware
package, and the 2.30 release which replaces as little as two packages.
Definitely worth checking out. And even if you are not a Gnome fan,
installing GSB allows you to compile or use a whole lot of other software
that has strong gnome dependencies (like the Lotus Notes I use at work).
The GSB also comes with a source-compiled OpenOffice.org package tuned
for Slackware.
</p><p>
Well, that's it. Thanks guys for allowing me to ramble on for so long.
</p>
<p><em>Thank you very much for the exciting interview, Eric! You are always welcome!</em></p>
