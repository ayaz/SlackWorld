  Are you on old school <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a>
  user who gave up that most brilliant of
  operating systems for no other reason than it seemed during the middle to
  late 1990's as the platform was dead in the water and going nowhere fast
  after company after company bought, collapsed then sold the Amiga brand
  on? Have you longed for those days when innovation truly was innovation
  and the Amiga range of personal computers rose high above the competition
  in both sales and usability? If your answer to any and all of the above
  is yes then you have no doubt tried AROS.  
  <a href="http://aros.sourceforge.net/">The AROS Research Operating
  System</a> formerly known as the Amiga Research Operating System
  which is almost at the stage of usability
  and can in fact be installed directly to hard drive these days and has a
  growing wealth of applications. AROS is as close to the old philosophy as
  one is ever going to see. It is a wonderful project that every once
  erstwhile Amiga user, who for whatever reason fled the platform in days
  one by, should check out.
 </p><p>
  But this article is not about AROS, as good as it is. No. It is about
  true Amiga emulators. UAE and the newer E-UAE. There are others but their
  popularity is not as high as those two. Indeed, I don't think those
  others like fellow or xfellow, and a few more besides, are still
  maintained.
 </p><p>
  I still own an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1200">Amiga&nbsp;1200</a>
  (A1200) which sits on my network plugging away.
  My children play the games on it. I have years old fidonet messages
  stored within YAM (Yet Another Mailer) as well as in archives stored for
  posterity but even with that machine available to me I simply love UAE,
  and more recently, E-UAE for no other reason than I can leave it running
  sat on screen 16 on my desktop available to do whatever it is I want to
  do on it.
 </p><p>
  I have always played with <a href="http://uae.coresystems.de/">UAE</a>
  from when it
  first came on the market. Back then it was called the Useless
  (or Unusable) Amiga Emulator&nbsp;[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE_%28emulator%29">1</a>]
  by some and for good reason. Back then it was as buggy a Hell
  and often times crashed without a good reason. Sometimes taking the whole
  OS with it as it crashed and burnt yet again. But as time rolled on UAE
  got better and better and more and more stable. Today it is totally
  usable and stable.
 </p><p>
  On checking for the latest version I stumbled across something calling
  itself <a href="http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae/">E-UAE</a>. 
  I went to check it out
  mainly to see what it was about and in what way it differed to UAE. The
  main difference as far as I can see is that E-UAE uses the 
  <a href="http://www.winuae.net/">WinUAE</a> core.
  On loading E-UAE for the first time other more subtle changes became
  apparent. The E-UAE control panel offers not only visual GUI differences
  but also usability changes. Other subtle changes make E-UAE my Amiga
  Emulator of choice now after years of UAE usage.
 </p><p>
  Both UAE and E-UAE have recently brought out new versions. As these are
  both Linux applications, unlike WinUAE, I will only be writing about
  things that concern them. Things that only work under the Microsoft OS
  are useless to us Linux based users anyway, unless of course you are
  masochist enough to run an emulated Amiga under WINE. Possible but ugly
  and quite probably slow.
 </p><p>
  UAE and E-UAE can be interchanged here as we go along this article. What
  applies to E-UAE also applies to UAE so to save me typing both names
  throughout the article I shall say that when I mention E-UAE you can
  simply replace it with UAE if your preference is towards that.
 </p><p>
  Both compile without errors on my x86_64 <a href="http://www.bluewhite64.com">Bluewhite64</a>
  install. Though to
  get a <tt>scsi.device</tt> on the emulated Amiga side there are bits needed from
  the <a href="http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/cdrecord.html">cdrtools</a>
  sources. You need to at least compile <b>cdrtools</b> then copy a
  few bits from there to where ever your UAE or E-UAE sources are. Once
  that is done you are ready to compile UAE or E-UAE. This was not a
  problem for me but may be a bit of a challenge for our non-technical
  minded brothers and sisters. If requested I can outline the exact
  procedure but any one with aspirations to using an Amiga emulator should
  be able to figure it out without too much trouble. There is a script in
  both extracted archive source trees in <tt>src/</tt> called <tt>install_libscg</tt>. 
  This was horribly broken for me and steadfastly refused to copy the relevant
  files. On further inspection is turns out that to get a <tt>scsi.device</tt> on
  the Amiga side one needs an older, much older, copy of <b>cdrtools</b> or
  <b>cdrecord</b>. Version 2.0 in fact. This <tt>scsi.device</tt> is however not a
  requirement so getting the <b>cdrtools</b> thing sorted is not a requirement
  either. That said, I do recommend you read the <tt>README</tt> provided in both
  source trees.
 </p><p>
  I created 3 virtual hard drives, which are really directories on the
  Bluewhite64 side. I called the virtual drives 'System', 'Work' and
  'HDGames'. This was achieved by first creating those named directories on
  the Bluewhite64 side then pointing E-UAE to them in the hard drive
  preferences tab within E-UAE. Upon installing Amiga&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 from
  <tt>.adf</tt>
  files I had created on my A1200 along with the required kickrom which I
  also created via my real A1200 the Hard drive install option of Amiga&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1
  saw these virtual drives as Amiga hard drives and proceeded to
  install onto 'System'. This install, to hard drive, was simplicity
  itself. It installed without any problems. A bare Amiga OS is nothing
  exciting. In fact I would go so far as to say it is boring to look at.

 </p>
 <p>
  Next I installed a TCP stack so I had at least got Internet access within
  E-UAE. I used <a href="http://www.jeacle.ie/pub/articles/amitcp/">AmiTCP</a>
  which again installed without issue. After editing a
  few files within amiTCP I rebooted. A quick, very quick, reboot later and
  my Amiga emulator was online. My next step was to visit
  <a href="http://www.aminet.net/">aminet</a>
  and download a few useful, and not so useful but
  wonderful to have, applications that I have always enjoyed using. The
  list of files I downloaded from Aminet is too long to list them all, but
  a few worth mentioning are Picasso96, MagicWB, Toolmanager, MUI and
  GuiArc. Those 4 applications alone make for a much better Workbench
  experience.
 </p><p>
  This process of making the emulated Amiga like my real A1200 was coming
  along nicely. I hit google in an excited attempt to locate some
  pre-configured Workbench setups I had used before. These being AIAB
  (Amiga In A Box) and AmiSYS. Both had been updated since I last used them
  in ernest which is always a good thing to see. These wonderful bundles are
  add-ons for WinUAE which works fine on Linux providing one gets the zip
  archive not the .exe file, after some manual tweaking to fix
  Amiga side. The executable flag on some files on the Amiga side
  <tt>.info</tt> files (which are icons that hold information for the program they
  match up with. More on this issue later.), on the Linux based platform
  that basically gives UAE/E-UAE/WinUAE a lovely look and feel. I would go
  so far as to say AIAB brings the emulated Amiga to life.
 </p><p>
  Using UAE or E-UAE and <a href="http://www.amigainabox.co.uk/">AIAB</a>
  or <a href="http://amigasys.german-amiga-community.de/index.php?page=download">AmiSys</a>
  negates the need to build up your own Amiga Workbench environment . For
  AIAB you will need a copy of the Workbench floppy disk in adf format from
  the Amiga installation set as well as a kick-start rom. These are
  available on the Internet but I will not be linking to them here as
  unless you actually have a paid for set of disks and a real Amiga then
  you are not legally allowed to use them. I had not used AmiSYS before and
  was delighted to see how close to my real A1200 install it was. After
  many years of using AIAB with UAE I have now switched allegiances and use
  E-UAE and AmiSYS. Be aware that if like me you have gone to the trouble
  of creating your own Workbench environment that both AIAB and AmiSYS both
  come with pre-configured hardfiles that act as Amiga hard drives. Not a
  problem really as one can keep your own work as a backup should anything
  go badly wrong with the AIAB (as it did) or AmiSYS installs.
 </p><p>
  The newer AIAB was more of a challenge to get installed and working as
  although installing it is not difficult once installed under a Linux OS
  it quite simply refused steadfastly to allow both UAE and E-UAE to boot
  up the Amiga. Bummer, thought I. Previous versions had always worked
  without error so why did the newer version not? Okay, the error was
  printed on the screen. "devs:monitors/uaegfx was not executable." To
  recover from this I created a hard drive within the emulated environment
  then installed Workbench&nbsp;3.1 separately within that. Then I moved the
  AIAB install into the emulated hard drive space so that I could
  investigate what had gone wrong.
 </p><p>
  Once booted into the Amiga I inspected the AIAB installed files and sure
  enough many files and associated <tt>.info</tt> files were indeed none executable.
  This meant several Amiga files would not or rather could not run. There
  was a lot of these all over the install. I traced what had caused the
  error, or at least what I thought caused the errors. This was an Amiga
  batch file that changes the icon set used. It would seem that the AIAB
  author used the wrong switches for <b>lzx</b>. Or rather he missed or neglected
  to use one. Once I added the missing switch to the various icon set
  switching batch files on executing them they all worked as expected.
 </p><p>
  I finally was looking at the familiar Amiga Workbench screen in all its
  glory.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="amiga/aiab-screenshot.jpg"><img src="amiga/aiab-screenshot-560x420.jpg" width="560" height="420" alt="" title="Aiab, 1024x768, 171kB"></a>
 </p>
 <p>
  AmiSYS uses the hardfile approach but the expansion pack they have is
  simply a directory. Once I had extracted both AmiSYS files and pointed
  UAE and E-UAE at them it just worked. The emulated Amiga booted straight
  into an Internet capable Amiga Workbench. Wonderful stuff. It looked so
  much like my real A1200 install that I simply have to use it and I do in
  preference to my previously used AIAB.
 </p>
 <p>Here is a screenshot of AmiSys booting up the emulated Amiga.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="amiga/bootup-picture.jpg"><img src="amiga/bootup-picture-560x420.jpg" border="0" alt="" title="Bootup picture, 800x600, 67kB"></a>
 </p>
 <p>And here is another screenshot showing the emulated Amiga wih AmiSys installed.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="amiga/advanced-workbench.jpg"><img src="amiga/advanced-workbench-560x420.jpg" border="0" alt="" title="Advanced Workbench, 1024x768, 232kB"></a>
 </p>
 <p>Be aware that the boot up picture is random so the one you see may differ
  as of course, being randomised the picture changes each boot. Also, the background
  picture, while being mostly obscured, is different from the default AmiSys install.</p>
 <p>
  After playing with both UAE and E-UAE I have to say both have their uses.
  For example, to create an Amiga hard drive I have to use UAE because
  E-UAE does not have the option to do this, leaning as it does to wards
  the directory on a linux drive. So, I fire up UAE, create the hardfile,
  save the settings then fire up E-UAE which sees the hard drive without
  problems. 
 </p><p>
  Finally. There are two major players in the Amiga emulation arena, UAE
  and E-UAE and two major players in the pre-configured Workbench arena,
  AIAB and AmiSYS. If I was to give a preference as to which two of those four
  one should use I would need to be honest and say E-UAE and AmiSYS make
  for a better Amiga/Workbench experience. That said,  all four could very
  easily be interchanged. For my day to day usage I use E-UAE for no other
  reason than its mouse tracker appears to work better. A minor thing you
  may think but the reality is that when working on the Amiga side and your
  mouse pointer is something like 2 inches from where the  Linux mouse
  pointer is or points this makes part of the Amiga screen unaccessible
  until you realize that by getting the pointer as close as possible to the
  top-left of the Amiga screen and coming in at the same point off the
  Linux side means the pointer of the Amiga and the Linux pointer are once
  again in harmony.
 </p><p>
  On recompiling UAE this pointer nuisance mysteriously went away. Most
  puzzling, but something to bare in mind.
