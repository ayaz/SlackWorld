            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>This short article describes how to set up the IPsec
          functionality in Linux 2.6 kernels, and how to use IPsec
          on Slackware Linux. Be aware that this is not an in-depth
          guide of the IPsec tools, please refer to the ipsec-tools
          documentation for more in-depth information about the
          various parameters and options that can be set.</p>

          <p>IPsec is a collection of protocols that provide
          authentication, encryption and compression. The IPsec
          protocol is defined in several RFCs, and is a mandatory
          part of the new IETF standard for IP traffic (IPv6). The
          following protocols are defined in the IPsec
          standard:</p>

          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>AH (Authentication Header) provides authenticity
                guarantee for transported packets. This is done by
                checksumming the packages using a cryptographic
                algorithm. If the checksum is found to be correct
                by the receiver, the receiver can be assured that
                the packet is not modified, and that the packet
                really originated from the reported sender
                (provided that the keys are only known by the
                sender and receiver).</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) is used to
                encrypt packets. This makes the data of the packet
                confident, and only readable by the host with the
                right decryption key.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>IPcomp (IP payload compression) provides
                compression before a packet is encrypted. This is
                useful, because encrypted data generally compresses
                worse than unencrypted data.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>IKE (Internet Key Exchange) provides the means
                to negotiate keys in secrecy. Please note that IKE
                is optional, keys can be configured manually.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>In this article we will focus on using ESP to encrypt
          traffic, and Racoon to do the initial key exchange. To
          use IPsec two types of entries should be added: security
          associations (SAs) and security policies (SPs). Security
          policies define IPsec policies for certain connections.
          For example, you can specify to encrypt all the packages
          to host <span class="emphasis"><i>192.168.1.11</i></span>
          with ESP. The kernel uses security associations to decide
          how the specified policy is going to be handled. For
          example, the encryption key and encryption algorithm
          settings for a connection are specified in a security
          association. We will manually set up the security
          policies, and let racoon take care of the security
          associations.</p>

        <div class="section">

            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "ipsec-slackware" id="ipsec-slackware"></a>The state
              of IPsec in Slackware</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Slackware Linux has provided a Linux 2.6 kernel since
          Slackware Linux 10.0. The 2.6 kernel is available in
          Slackware 10.0 and 10.1 from the <tt>testing</tt>
          directory on CD2 of the Slackware Linux CD sets, or any
          of the official Slackware mirrors. The default Slackware
          2.6 kernel has support for AH, ESP and IPcomp in for both
          IPv4 and IPv6. If you are compiling a custom kernel
          enable use at least the following options in your kernel
          configuration:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
CONFIG_INET_AH=y
CONFIG_INET_ESP=y
CONFIG_INET_IPCOMP=y
    
</pre>

          <p>Or you can compile support for IPsec protocols as a
          module:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
CONFIG_INET_AH=m
CONFIG_INET_ESP=m
CONFIG_INET_IPCOMP=m
    
</pre>

          <p>When you choose to compile IPsec support as a module,
          make sure that the required modules are loaded. For
          example, if you are going to use ESP for IPv4
          connections, load the <span class=
          "emphasis"><i>esp4</i></span> module.</p>

          <p>Besides having kernel support you need userland tools
          to set up IPsec connections, and an IKE daemon for doing
          key exchanges. For IPsec with Linux 2.6 the Linux port of
          the KAME IPsec tools are the most widely used utilities.
          The KAME IPsec tools are not included in Slackware Linux
          10.0 or 10.1. The next section describes how to install
          the KAME IPsec tools.</p>

            <p>You can download the latest sources for the KAME
            IPsec tools at <a href=
            "http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net" target=
            "_top">http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net</a>. After
            downloading the sources you can compile the KAME IPsec
            tools in the traditional way:</p>
            <pre class="screen">

                  detecting wether any of the hosts for which

                  When this is the case the security associations
                  to that host can be removed.</p>

                  helps overcoming this problem. Configuring NAT-T

            <p>For this article SlackBuild script has been made
            available. The SlackBuild script builds a package that
            includes the default Racoon configuration that is used
            in this article. You can download the SlackBuild script
            through this link:
            <a href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/slackworld/ipsec-tools-slackbuild.tar.gz"
            target="_top">ipsec-tools-slackbuild.tar.gz</a>.</p>

            <p>You can use this SlackBuild script to build an
            ipsec-tools package. The procedure is quite simple,
            unpack the in the usual way:</p>
            <pre class="screen">
# <b>tar zxf /path/to/ipsec-tools-slackbuild.tar.gz</b>
      
</pre>

            <p>After unpacking the archive, you can drop the
            ipsec-tools 0.5 source tarball in the
            <tt>ipsec-tools</tt> directory, and execute <b>sh
            ipsec-tools.SlackBuild</b>. If the compilation was
            succesful, the package will be available as
            <tt>/tmp/ipsec-tools-0.5-i386-1.tgz</tt>, which you can
            install with <b>installpkg</b>.</p>

            <p>If you are using a newer source tarball you should
            also update the version number in the
            <tt>ipsec-tools.SlackBuild</tt> script.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "ipsec-spd" id="ipsec-spd"></a>Setting up security
              policies</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>At this point we can start to configure IPsec. The
          first thing you will want to do is to set up some IPsec
          policies. These policies define for what connections you
          would like to apply one of the IPsec protocols. Policies
          can be added to the security policy database (SPD) in the
          kernel with the <b>setkey</b> command. <b>setkey</b> can
          read security policies from a file, so it is a good idea
          to put the policies in a file, for example
          <tt>/etc/setkey.conf</tt>. Let's get started by looking
          at an example:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
#!/usr/sbin/setkey -f

# Flush SPD
spdflush;

spdadd 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.11 any -P out ipsec
        esp/transport//require;

spdadd 192.168.1.11 192.168.1.10 any -P in ipsec
        esp/transport//require;
    
</pre>

          <p>You should have no trouble recognizing the first line,
          which sets <b>/usr/sbin/setkey</b> to be the interpreter
          for this file (in case it is executed). The first thing
          we do is flushing the security policy database, with the
          <b>spdflush</b> command. If you have set up any other
          security policies that you want to keep you should not
          flush the security policy database.</p>

          <p>The next to commands add policies to the security
          policy database. The following syntax is used for
          <b>spdadd</b> commands:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
spdadd src_range dst_range upperspec policy ;
    
</pre>

          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p><span class="emphasis"><i>src_range</i></span>:
                the source of the packet, this can be a network
                address range or a single IP address.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><span class="emphasis"><i>dst_range</i></span>:
                the destination of the packets, this can also be a
                network address range or a single IP address.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><span class="emphasis"><i>upperspec</i></span>:
                this is the upper layer protocol to be used. This
                is the protocol that is embedded in the new IPsec
                protocol packages. Any protocol from
                <tt>/etc/protocol</tt> can be specified, but not
                all these protocols work with IPsec. Normally the
                protocol to be Normally either <span class=
                "emphasis"><i>tcp</i></span>, <span class=
                "emphasis"><i>udp</i></span>, <span class=
                "emphasis"><i>icmp</i></span> or <span class=
                "emphasis"><i>any</i></span> are specified.
                <span class="emphasis"><i>any</i></span> stands for
                &ldquo;any protocol&rdquo;.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><span class="emphasis"><i>policy</i></span>: the
                policy to be applied to the packet that matches
                these criteria.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>We can now deduct that the first command sets up a
          security policy for packets traveling from 192.168.1.10
          to 192.168.1.11 with any protocol, and the second command
          sets up the same policy in reverse direction. The policy
          specification of the spdadd command can have a few forms,
          in this example we will only use this (simplified)
          form:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
-P direction ipsec protocol/mode/src-dst/level

                specifies how this policy should be handled when
                there are, or are not, set up security
                associations. We will only use the <span class=
                "emphasis"><i>require</i></span> level, which will
                require a security association to be set up. This
                means that no packets that match the policy will be
                sent or received, unless the association is set up,
                guaranteeing that the packets are encrypted.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Now that the syntax of the policy is explained, it
          should be no trouble to read the policies of the two
          example SPD commands. Both policies specify that we
          require usage of ESP for packets that match the criteria.
          The first command specifies a policy for outgoing
          packets, the second command for incoming packets.</p>

          <p>At this point policies are set up for packets sent out
          on 192.168.1.10 going to 192.168.1.11, and packets coming
          in from 192.168.1.11 on 192.168.1.10. On the machine with
          IP address 192.168.1.11 we can use the same policy with
          the <span class="emphasis"><i>in</i></span> and
          <span class="emphasis"><i>out</i></span> parameters
          swapped:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
#!/usr/sbin/setkey -f

# Flush SPD
spdflush;

spdadd 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.11 any -P in ipsec
        esp/transport//require;

spdadd 192.168.1.11 192.168.1.10 any -P out ipsec
        esp/transport//require;
    
</pre>

          <p>After setting up some policies you can add them to the
          kernel security policies database with the <b>setkey
          -f</b> command, for example: <b>setkey -f
          /etc/setkey.conf</b>. If you want to set up these
          policies automatically when a system boots, you can add
          something along these lines to
          <b>/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1</b>:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
if [ -x /usr/sbin/setkey ] &amp;&amp; [ -r /etc/setkey.conf ]; then
  /usr/sbin/setkey -f /etc/setkey.conf
fi
    
</pre>

          <p>For a more extensive explanation of the <b>setkey</b>,
          read the <b>setkey</b>(8) manual page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "ipsec-racoon" id="ipsec-racoon"></a>Setting up
              racoon</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>When the kernel handles a packet for which a security
          policy is set up, the kernel will look up the security
          associations database (SAD) to see what parameters (e.g.
          encryption key) should be used for handling the packet.
          We will use the racoon daemon to set up security
          associations.</p>

          <p>Racoon establishes a security association after a key
          exchange that is done in two stages:</p>

          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p><span class="emphasis"><i>Phase 1</i></span>:
                during this phase the authenticity of another host
                is verified. When the verification is successful, a
                secure channel is set up between the two hosts,
                that is used to continue the key exchange. One of
                the commonly used methods of verifying the
                authenticity of another host is by using a
                pre-shared key that both hosts should know.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><span class="emphasis"><i>Phase 2</i></span>:
                during this step the security association for
                communication with the other host is set up. For
                ESP this involves choosing the encryption algorithm
                to be used, and generation of the keys that are
                used for encrypting packets.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>An example racoon configuration is listed below. This
          configuration is also used in the SlackBuild script that
          is linked from this article. Configuration of racoon is
          extensively described in the <b>racoon.conf</b>(5) manual
          page. In short, we define two sections, one for phase 1
          (<span class="emphasis"><i>remote</i></span>) and one for
          phase 2 (<span class="emphasis"><i>sainfo</i></span>),
          that specify which algorithms should be used for
          encryption and hashing. In addition, we specify in the
          <span class="emphasis"><i>remote</i></span> section that
          we would like to use pre-shared keys to verify the
          authenticity of the other host. As specified with the
          <span class="emphasis"><i>path pre_shared_key</i></span>
          option, the <tt>/etc/racoon/psk.txt</tt> file will be
          used as the pre-shared key database.</p>
          <pre class="screen">
# search this file for pre_shared_key with various ID key.
path pre_shared_key "/etc/racoon/psk.txt";

# racoon will look for certificate file in the directory,
# if the certificate/certificate request payload is received.
path certificate "/etc/racoon/certs";

remote anonymous
{
        exchange_mode aggressive, main;
        my_identifier address;
        proposal {
                encryption_algorithm 3des;
                hash_algorithm sha1;
                authentication_method pre_shared_key;
                dh_group 2;
        }
}

sainfo anonymous
{
        pfs_group 2;
        encryption_algorithm 3des, blowfish 448, rijndael;
        authentication_algorithm hmac_sha1, hmac_md5;
        compression_algorithm deflate;
}
    
</pre>

          <p>The pre-shared key database has a very simple
          two-column format. The first column specifies the host
          name or IP address, the second column the shared key.
          Both columns are separated with whitespace. When the key
          is prefixed with <span class="emphasis"><i>0x</i></span>,
          the key is interpreted as a hexadecimal number. For
          example, an entry in the database could look like this
          (obviously, the key should be a good random string of
          letters, numbers and other characters):</p>
          <pre class="screen">
192.168.1.11    This is some secret key
    
</pre>

          <p>Racoon can now be started with the <b>racoon</b>
          command. The SlackBuild script includes a startup script
          for racoon. If you want to start racoon when the system
          boots, make the startup script executable:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
# <b>chmod a+x /etc/rc.d/rc.racoon</b>
    
</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "id2409820" id="id2409820"></a>Testing your IPsec
              configuration</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>After you have added the security policies to the
          security policy database, and started Racoon, you can
          test your IPsec configuration. For instance, you could
          ping the other host to start with. The first time you
          ping the other host, this will fail:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
$ <b>ping 192.168.1.11</b>
connect: Resource temporarily unavailable
    
</pre>

          <p>The reason for this is that the security associations
          still have to be set up. But the ICMP packet will trigger
          the key exchange. ping will trigger the key exchange. You
          can see whether the exchange was succesful or not by
          looking at the Racoon log messages in
          <tt>/var/log/messages</tt>. A succesful key exhange looks
          like this:</p>
          <pre class="screen">

</pre>

          <p>After the key exchange, you can verify that IPsec is
          set up correctly by analyzing the packets that go in and
          out with <b>tcpdump</b>. tcpdump is available in the
          <span class="emphasis"><i>n</i></span> diskset. Suppose
          that the outgoing connection to the other host goes
          through the <span class="emphasis"><i>eth0</i></span>
          interface, you can analyze the packats that go though the
          <span class="emphasis"><i>eth0</i></span> interface with
          <b>tcpdump -i eth0</b>. If the outgoing packets are
          encrypted with ESP, you can see this in the
          <b>tcpdump</b> output. For example:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
