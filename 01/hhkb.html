        <h2 class="subtitle">UNIX keyboards done the right way</h2>

        <p><b>Author:</b> Daniel de Kok</p>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "id2401352" id="id2401352"></a>Introduction</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Every UNIX user who has ever touched more than
          <a href="http://kate.kde.org/" target="_top">Kate</a> or
          <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/" target=
          "_top">gedit</a> knows that standard PC keyboards are
          plain wrong. First, of all the ESC and CTRL keys are
          wrongly placed. Besides that the average keyboard is like
          a dinosaur when you only need a few letters for
          navigation. One common technique to solve the first
          problem is to remap Caps lock to CTRL, and the backtick
          key to ESC. But <a href="http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/"
          target="_top">PFU Limited</a> (a Fujitsu company) has
          made a series of keyboards designed to solve both
          problems, the <a href=
          "http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/" target=
          "_top">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a>.</p>

          <p>Since I am an avid elvis/vim/nvi user I have been
          watching development around the Happy Hacking Keyboard
          (HHKB) for quite some time. Recently I purchased a HHKB
          Lite 2 white USB for $59.95 from <a href=
          "http://www.linuxcentral.com" target="_top">Linux
          Central</a>. I chose for the Lite 2 version for two
          reasons: the other models are to expensive for a student
          budget, and it has inverted T arrow keys. Both the normal
          and Pro versions do not have inverted T arrows, but I
          think it is certainly possible to manage to survive
          without.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "id2401415" id="id2401415"></a>Keyboard

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The keyboard arrived in a somewhat cheap looking blue
          box, that contains has a short and handy overview of the
          keyboard and keyboard settings on the back. It was only
          until I opened the box that I realized how small the
          keyboard actually is (quite cute). The footprint of the
          HHKB is <a href=
          "http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/leaflet/kbhiaku.html"
          target="_top">compared</a> to other keyboards on the
          website, but when you actually see the keyboard, the
          cut-off seems really radical. It really cleans up my
          desk.</p>

            <p><b>Blowfish is guarding the keyboard</b></p>
          </div>

          <p>The keyboard has some really nice features, like two
          upstream USB ports (of course, only the USB version),
          that are very handy when you carry around USB mass
          storage alot. Besides that there are some dip switches
          hidden behind a small plate that you can pop off. The
          table listed below gives a short overview of the dip
          switches.</p>

          <div class="table">
            <p><b>Table 1. Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 dip
            switches</b></p>

            <table summary=
            "Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite 2 dip switches" border=
            "1">
              <colgroup>
                <col>
                <col>
              </colgroup>

              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Dip switch</th>

                  <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>

              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>

                  <td>Enable/disable upstream USB ports</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td>2</td>

                  <td>Not used</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>

                  <td>Delete is delete/Delete is backspace</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td>4</td>

                  <td>Swapping of ALT and diamond keys</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>These dip switches are well-documented in the
          Japanese/English leaflet that is included in the box. At
          first the switches looked a bit easily breakable to me,
          but I managed to use them without breaking anything, and
          I am probably only going to set the switches once.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "id2401549" id="id2401549"></a>Configuring the
              keyboard</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Configuring the keyboard involves two steps: setting
          the dip switches, and setting up the software. I turned
          switch 3 to let the delete key act as backspace, since I
          use backspace quite a lot when I am editing.</p>

          <p>As I expected the software configuration turned out to
          be a no-brainer: hotplugging + kernel USB magic
          automatically detected the keyboard:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
input: USB HID v1.00 Keyboard [Chicony  PFU-65 USB Keyboard] on usb-0000:00:10.0-2.1
    
</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "id2401574" id="id2401574"></a>How it feels</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Immediately after plugging in the keyboard and typing
          some shell commands it occured to me that the HHKB feels
          very natural in my hands. It feels like the keyboard is
          well thought-out, and that even normal letter keys feel
          better than an average keyboard. Having the CTRL and ESC
          keys at another place did not involve much of a
          relearning curve. I never used CTRL or ESC remappings,
          but automatically started to use the CTRL and ESC
          correctly on the HHKB.</p>

          <p>The HHKB Lite 2 keys use a membrane switch that is
          depressed by a rubber cap. This gives a minor click, but
          not as much as old IBM keyboards. I personally severy
          dislike keyboards without a click, because it gives good
          feedback when I type. My fingers have got used to that
          over years. The click on this keyboard is just about
          right. The <a href=
          "http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/leaflet/keyspec.html"
          target="_top">key pressure</a> of the Lite 2 keyboard is
          about 55g, which feels pretty normal.</p>

          <p>My primary critique about the HHKB is that the
          backtick key is at an awkward place. Is use it quite a
          lot when I am editing shell scripts. This can be worked
          around by remapping the diamond key.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
              "id2401618" id="id2401618"></a>Conclusion</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Although keyboards are a matter of personal
          preference, I wholeheartedly recommend the Happy Hacking
          Keyboard Lite 2 to anyone who uses Slackware Linux in a
          UNIXy way. If you are not used to work wth UNIX editors
          like vi, it may be a bit hard to get used to the HHKB,
          since some keys are not directly available (like the
          function keys). But if you are, this keyboard just feels
          perfect, with everything you need available without much
          hand movement. If you are still using a lot of garbage
          keys this is a good opportunity to learn to het rid of
          them.</p>

          <p>After using the HHKB for a short while you will see
          how used you get to it when you use another keyboard. You
          will be hitting the Caps lock key all the time. But there
          really is no excuse not to cary a USB HHKB with you with
          its current size. I would love to get my hands on a
          normal or Pro version of the keyboard, but with the price
          tags of the other versions, I guess nobody has a spare
          for me ;).</p>
